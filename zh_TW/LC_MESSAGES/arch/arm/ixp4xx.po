"Intel's IXP4xx network processor is a highly integrated SOC that is targeted "
"for network applications, though it has become popular in industrial control "
"and other areas due to low cost and power consumption. The IXP4xx family "
"currently consists of several processors that support different network "
"offload functions such as encryption, routing, firewalling, etc. The IXP46x "
"family is an updated version which supports faster speeds, new memory and "
"flash configurations, and more integration such as an on-chip I2C controller."
