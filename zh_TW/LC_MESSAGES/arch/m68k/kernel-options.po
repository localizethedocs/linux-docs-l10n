"specifying the root device, because the kernel cannot see this symlink "
"before mounting the root FS and it isn't in the table above. If you use it, "
"the root device will not be set at all, without an error message. Another "
"example: You cannot use a partition on e.g. the sixth SCSI disk as the root "
"filesystem, if you want to specify it by name. This is, because only the "
"devices up to /dev/sde are in the table above, but not /dev/sdf. Although, "
"you can use the sixth SCSI disk for the root FS, but you have to specify the "
