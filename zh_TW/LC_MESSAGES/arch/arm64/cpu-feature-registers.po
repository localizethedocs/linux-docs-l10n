"The ARM architecture defines a set of feature registers, which describe the "
"capabilities of the CPU/system. Access to these system registers is "
"restricted from EL0 and there is no reliable way for an application to "
"extract this information to make better decisions at runtime. There is "
"limited information available to the application via HWCAPs, however there "
"are some issues with their usage."

"Any change to the HWCAPs requires an update to userspace (e.g libc) to "
