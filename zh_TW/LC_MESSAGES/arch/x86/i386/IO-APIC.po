"Most (all) Intel-MP compliant SMP boards have the so-called 'IO-APIC', which "
"is an enhanced interrupt controller. It enables us to route hardware "
"interrupts to multiple CPUs, or to CPU groups. Without an IO-APIC, "
"interrupts from hardware will be delivered only to the CPU which boots the "
"operating system (usually CPU#0)."

"Linux supports all variants of compliant SMP boards, including ones with "
"multiple IO-APICs. Multiple IO-APICs are used in high-end servers to "

"These INTA-D PCI IRQs are always 'local to the card', their real meaning "
"depends on which slot they are in. If you look at the daisy chaining "
"diagram, a card in slot4, issuing INTA IRQ, it will end up as a signal on "
"PIRQ4 of the PCI chipset. Most cards issue INTA, this creates optimal "
"distribution between the PIRQ lines. (distributing IRQ sources properly is "
"not a necessity, PCI IRQs can be shared at will, but it's a good for "
"performance to have non shared interrupts). Slot5 should be used for "
"videocards, they do not use interrupts normally, thus they are not daisy "
"chained either."
