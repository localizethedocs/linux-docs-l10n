"The Extcon (External Connector) subsystem provides a unified framework for "
"managing external connectors in Linux systems. It allows drivers to report "
"the state of external connectors and provides a standardized interface for "
"userspace to query and monitor these states."

"Extcon is particularly useful in modern devices with multiple connectivity "
"options, such as smartphones, tablets, and laptops. It helps manage various "

"Smartphone USB-C port: A single USB-C port on a smartphone can serve "
"multiple functions. Extcon can manage the different states of this port, "

"USB Power Delivery) - Audio output (USB-C headphones) - Video output (USB-C "

"Smart TV HDMI ports: In a smart TV, Extcon can manage multiple HDMI ports, "

"player)."

"The Extcon framework simplifies the development of drivers for these complex "
"scenarios by providing a standardized way to report and query connector "
"states, handle mutually exclusive connections, and manage connector "
"properties. This allows for more robust and flexible handling of external "
"connections in modern devices."
