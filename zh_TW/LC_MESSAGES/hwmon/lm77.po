"The LM77 implements one temperature sensor. The temperature sensor "
"incorporates a band-gap type temperature sensor, 10-bit ADC, and a digital "
"comparator with user-programmable upper and lower limit values."

"The LM77 implements 3 limits: low (temp1_min), high (temp1_max) and critical "
"(temp1_crit.) It also implements an hysteresis mechanism which applies to "
"all 3 limits. The relative difference is stored in a single register on the "
"chip, which means that the relative difference between the limit and its "
"hysteresis is always the same for all 3 limits."

"When setting a limit, its hysteresis will automatically follow, the "
"difference staying unchanged. For example, if the old critical limit was 80 "
"degrees C, and the hysteresis was 75 degrees C, and you change the critical "
"limit to 90 degrees C, then the hysteresis will automatically change to 85 "
"degrees C."

"All 3 hysteresis can't be set independently. We decided to make "
"temp1_crit_hyst writable, while temp1_min_hyst and temp1_max_hyst are read-"
"only. Setting temp1_crit_hyst writes the difference between temp1_crit_hyst "
"and temp1_crit into the chip, and the same relative hysteresis applies "
"automatically to the low and high limits."
