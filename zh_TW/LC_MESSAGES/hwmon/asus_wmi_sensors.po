"The WMI implementation in some of Asus' BIOSes is buggy. This can result in "
"fans stopping, fans getting stuck at max speed, or temperature readouts "
"getting stuck. This is not an issue with the driver, but the BIOS. The Prime "
"X470 Pro seems particularly bad for this. The more frequently the WMI "
"interface is polled the greater the potential for this to happen. Until you "
"have subjected your computer to an extended soak test while polling the "
"sensors frequently, don't leave you computer unattended. Upgrading to new "
"BIOS version with method version greater than or equal to two should rectify "
"the issue."
