"Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is "
"triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. Fan "
"readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4 or 8) to give the "
"readings more range or accuracy. Not all RPM values can accurately be "
"represented, so some rounding is done. With a divider of 1, the lowest "
"representable value is 480 RPM."

"The 2103-2 and 2103-4 variants have a third temperature sensor, which can be "
"connected to two anti-parallel diodes.  These values can be read as temp3 "
"and temp4.  If only one diode is attached to this channel, temp4 will show "
"as \"fault\".  The module parameter \"apd=0\" can be used to suppress this "
"4th channel when anti-parallel diodes are not fitted."
