"The KEBA fan controller is an IP core for FPGAs, which monitors the health "
"and controls the speed of a fan. The fan is typically used to cool the CPU "
"and the whole device. E.g., the CP500 FPGA includes this IP core to monitor "
"and control the fan of PLCs and the corresponding cp500 driver creates an "
"auxiliary device for the kfan driver."

"This driver provides information about the fan health to user space. The "
"user space shall be informed if the fan is removed or blocked. Additionally, "
"the speed in RPM is reported for fans with tacho signal."

"For fan control PWM is supported. For PWM 255 equals 100%. None-regulable "
"fans can be turned on with PWM 255 and turned off with PWM 0."
