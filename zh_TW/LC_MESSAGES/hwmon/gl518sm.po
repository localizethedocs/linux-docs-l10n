"For the revision 0x00 chip, the in0, in1, and in2  values (+5V, +3V, and "
"+12V) CANNOT be read. This is a limitation of the chip, not the driver."

"This driver supports the Genesys Logic GL518SM chip. There are at least two "
"revision of this chip, which we call revision 0x00 and 0x80. Revision 0x80 "
"chips support the reading of all voltages and revision 0x00 only for VIN3."

"The GL518SM implements one temperature sensor, two fan rotation speed "
"sensors, and four voltage sensors. It can report alarms through the computer "
"speakers."

msgid ""
"Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. An alarm goes off while the "
"temperature is above the over temperature limit, and has not yet dropped "
"below the hysteresis limit. The alarm always reflects the current situation. "
"Measurements are guaranteed between -10 degrees and +110 degrees, with a "
"accuracy of +/-3 degrees."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/gl518sm.rst:49
msgid ""
"Rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is "
"triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. In "
"case when you have selected to turn fan1 off, no fan1 alarm is triggered."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/gl518sm.rst:53
msgid ""
"Fan readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4 or 8) to give "
"the readings more range or accuracy.  Not all RPM values can accurately be "
"represented, so some rounding is done. With a divider of 2, the lowest "
"representable value is around 1900 RPM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/gl518sm.rst:58
msgid ""
"Voltage sensors (also known as VIN sensors) report their values in volts. An "
"alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum or "
"maximum limit. Note that minimum in this case always means 'closest to "
"zero'; this is important for negative voltage measurements. The VDD input "
"measures voltages between 0.000 and 5.865 volt, with a resolution of 0.023 "
"volt. The other inputs measure voltages between 0.000 and 4.845 volt, with a "
"resolution of 0.019 volt. Note that revision 0x00 chips do not support "
"reading the current voltage of any input except for VIN3; limit setting and "
"alarms work fine, though."

"When an alarm is triggered, you can be warned by a beeping signal through "
"your computer speaker. It is possible to enable all beeping globally, or "
"only the beeping for some alarms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register "
"is read at least once (except for temperature alarms). This means that the "
"cause for the alarm may already have disappeared! Note that in the current "
"implementation, all hardware registers are read whenever any data is read "
"(unless it is less than 1.5 seconds since the last update). This means that "
"you can easily miss once-only alarms."

msgid ""
"The GL518SM only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often "
"will do no harm, but will return 'old' values."
