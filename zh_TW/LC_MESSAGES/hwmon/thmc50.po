msgid ""
"The THMC50 implements: an internal temperature sensor, support for an "
"external diode-type temperature sensor (compatible w/ the diode sensor "
"inside many processors), and a controllable fan/analog_out DAC. For the "
"temperature sensors, limits can be set through the appropriate "
"Overtemperature Shutdown register and Hysteresis register. Each value can be "
"set and read to half-degree accuracy.  An alarm is issued (usually to a "
"connected LM78) when the temperature gets higher then the Overtemperature "
"Shutdown value; it stays on until the temperature falls below the Hysteresis "
"value. All temperatures are in degrees Celsius, and are guaranteed within a "
"range of -55 to +125 degrees."

"The ADM1022 works the same as THMC50 but it is faster (5 Hz instead of 1 Hz "
"for THMC50). It can be also put in a new mode to handle additional remote "
"temperature sensor. The driver use the mode set by BIOS by default."

"In case the BIOS is broken and the mode is set incorrectly, you can force "
"the mode with additional remote temperature with adm1022_temp3 parameter. A "
"typical symptom of wrong setting is a fan forced to full speed."
