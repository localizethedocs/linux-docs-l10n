"The W83L785TS-S is a digital temperature sensor. It senses the temperature "
"of a single external diode. The high limit is theoretically defined as 85 or "
"100 degrees C through a combination of external resistors, so the user "
"cannot change it. Values seen so far suggest that the two possible limits "
"are actually 95 and 110 degrees C. The datasheet is rather poor and "
"obviously inaccurate on several points including this one."

"The w83l785ts driver will not update its values more frequently than every "
"other second; reading them more often will do no harm, but will return 'old' "

"On some systems (Asus), the BIOS is known to interfere with the driver and "
"cause read errors. Or maybe the W83L785TS-S chip is simply unreliable, we "
"don't really know. The driver will retry a given number of times (5 by "
"default) and then give up, returning the old value (or 0 if there is no old "
"value). It seems to work well enough so that you should not notice anything. "
"Thanks to James Bolt for helping test this feature."
