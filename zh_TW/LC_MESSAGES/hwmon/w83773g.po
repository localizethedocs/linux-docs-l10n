"This driver implements support for Nuvoton W83773G temperature sensor chip. "
"This chip implements one local and two remote sensors. The chip also "
"features offsets for the two remote sensors which get added to the input "
"readings. The chip does all the scaling by itself and the driver therefore "
"reports true temperatures that don't need any user-space adjustments. "
"Temperature is measured in degrees Celsius. The chip is wired over I2C/SMBus "
"and specified over a temperature range of -40 to +125 degrees Celsius (for "
"local sensor) and -40 to +127 degrees Celsius (for remote sensors). "
"Resolution for both the local and remote channels is 0.125 degree C."
