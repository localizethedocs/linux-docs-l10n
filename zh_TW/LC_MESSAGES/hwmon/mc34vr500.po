"This driver implements initial support for the NXP MC34VR500 PMIC. The "
"MC34VR500 monitors the temperature, input voltage and output currents and "
"provides corresponding alarms. For the temperature, the chip can send "
"interrupts if the temperature rises above one of the following values: 110°, "
"120°, 125° and 130° Celsius. For the input voltage, an interrupt is sent "
"when the voltage drops below 2.8V."
