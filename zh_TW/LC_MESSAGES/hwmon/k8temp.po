"This driver permits reading temperature sensor(s) embedded inside AMD K8 "
"family CPUs (Athlon64/FX, Opteron). Official documentation says that it "
"works from revision F of K8 core, but in fact it seems to be implemented for "
"all revisions of K8 except the first two revisions (SH-B0 and SH-B3)."
