"The SMSC SCH5627 hardware monitoring part also contains an integrated "

"The SCH5627 allows for partially controlling the fan speed. If a temperature "
"channel exceeds tempX_max, all fans are forced to maximum speed. The same is "
"not true for tempX_crit, presumably some other measures to cool down the "
"system are take in this case. In which way the value of fanX_min affects the "
"fan speed is currently unknown."
