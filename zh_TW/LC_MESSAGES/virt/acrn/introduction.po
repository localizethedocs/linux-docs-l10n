"The ACRN Hypervisor is a Type 1 hypervisor, running directly on bare-metal "
"hardware. It has a privileged management VM, called Service VM, to manage "
"User VMs and do I/O emulation."

"ACRN userspace is an application running in the Service VM that emulates "
"devices for a User VM based on command line configurations. ACRN Hypervisor "
"Service Module (HSM) is a kernel module in the Service VM which provides "
"hypervisor services to the ACRN userspace."

"ACRN userspace allocates memory for the User VM, configures and initializes "
"the devices used by the User VM, loads the virtual bootloader, initializes "
"the virtual CPU state and handles I/O request accesses from the User VM. It "
"uses ioctls to communicate with the HSM. HSM implements hypervisor services "
"by interacting with the ACRN Hypervisor via hypercalls. HSM exports a char "
"device interface (/dev/acrn_hsm) to userspace."
