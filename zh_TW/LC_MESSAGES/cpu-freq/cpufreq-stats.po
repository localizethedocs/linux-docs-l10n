"cpufreq-stats is a driver that provides CPU frequency statistics for each "
"CPU. These statistics are provided in /sysfs as a bunch of read_only "
"interfaces. This interface (when configured) will appear in a separate "
"directory under cpufreq in /sysfs (<sysfs root>/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/"
"cpufreq/stats/) for each CPU. Various statistics will form read_only files "
"under this directory."

"This driver is designed to be independent of any particular cpufreq_driver "
