msgid ""
"The bandwidth allowed for a group is specified using a quota and period. "
"Within each given \"period\" (microseconds), a task group is allocated up to "
"\"quota\" microseconds of CPU time. That quota is assigned to per-cpu run "
"queues in slices as threads in the cgroup become runnable. Once all quota "
"has been assigned any additional requests for quota will result in those "
"threads being throttled. Throttled threads will not be able to run again "
"until the next period when the quota is replenished."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scheduler/sched-bwc.rst:20
msgid ""
"A group's unassigned quota is globally tracked, being refreshed back to "
"cfs_quota units at each period boundary. As threads consume this bandwidth "
"it is transferred to cpu-local \"silos\" on a demand basis. The amount "
"transferred within each of these updates is tunable and described as the "

"This guaranteeds both that every deadline is met and that the system is "

"For example, have u_i = {x,e}_i, where x is the p(95) and x+e p(100) (the "
"traditional WCET). This effectively allows u to be smaller, increasing the "
"efficiency (we can pack more tasks in the system), but at the cost of "
"missing deadlines when all the odds line up. However, it does maintain "
"stability, since every overrun must be paired with an underrun as long as "
"our x is above the average."

"For cgroup cpu constrained applications that are cpu limited this is a "
"relatively moot point because they will naturally consume the entirety of "
"their quota as well as the entirety of each cpu-local slice in each period. "
"As a result it is expected that nr_periods roughly equal nr_throttled, and "

#: ../../../scheduler/sched-bwc.rst:178
msgid ""
"For highly-threaded, non-cpu bound applications this non-expiration nuance "
"allows applications to briefly burst past their quota limits by the amount "
"of unused slice on each cpu that the task group is running on (typically at "
"most 1ms per cpu or as defined by min_cfs_rq_runtime).  This slight burst "
"only applies if quota had been assigned to a cpu and then not fully used or "
"returned in previous periods. This burst amount will not be transferred "
"between cores. As a result, this mechanism still strictly limits the task "
"group to quota average usage, albeit over a longer time window than a single "
"period.  This also limits the burst ability to no more than 1ms per cpu.  "
"This provides better more predictable user experience for highly threaded "
"applications with small quota limits on high core count machines. It also "
"eliminates the propensity to throttle these applications while "
"simultaneously using less than quota amounts of cpu. Another way to say "
"this, is that by allowing the unused portion of a slice to remain valid "
"across periods we have decreased the possibility of wastefully expiring "
"quota on cpu-local silos that don't need a full slice's amount of cpu time."

"The interaction between cpu-bound and non-cpu-bound-interactive applications "
"should also be considered, especially when single core usage hits 100%. If "
"you gave each of these applications half of a cpu-core and they both got "
"scheduled on the same CPU it is theoretically possible that the non-cpu "
"bound application will use up to 1ms additional quota in some periods, "
"thereby preventing the cpu-bound application from fully using its quota by "
"that same amount. In these instances it will be up to the CFS algorithm (see "
"sched-design-CFS.rst) to decide which application is chosen to run, as they "
"will both be runnable and have remaining quota. This runtime discrepancy "
"will be made up in the following periods when the interactive application "
"idles."
