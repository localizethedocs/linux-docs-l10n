"The sym53c500_cs driver originated as an add-on to David Hinds' pcmcia-cs "
"package, and was written by Tom Corner (tcorner@via.at).  A rewrite was long "
"overdue, and the current version addresses the following concerns:"

"All the USE_BIOS code has been ripped out.  It was never used, and could not "
"have worked anyway.  The USE_DMA code is likewise gone.  Many thanks to "
"YOKOTA Hiroshi (nsp_cs driver) and David Hinds (qlogic_cs driver) for the "
"code fragments I shamelessly adapted for this work.  Thanks also to "
"Christoph Hellwig for his patient tutelage while I stumbled about."

"The Symbios Logic 53c500 chip was used in the \"newer\" (circa 1997) version "
"of the New Media Bus Toaster PCMCIA SCSI controller.  Presumably there are "
"other products using this chip, but I've never laid eyes (much less hands) "
"on one."

"Through the years, there have been a number of downloads of the pcmcia-cs "
"version of this driver, and I guess it worked for those users.  It worked "
"for Tom Corner, and it works for me.  Your mileage will probably vary."
