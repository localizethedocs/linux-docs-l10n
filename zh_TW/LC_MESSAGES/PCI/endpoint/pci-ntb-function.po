"PCI Non-Transparent Bridges (NTB) allow two host systems to communicate with "
"each other by exposing each host as a device to the other host. NTBs "
"typically support the ability to generate interrupts on the remote machine, "
"expose memory ranges as BARs, and perform DMA.  They also support "
"scratchpads, which are areas of memory within the NTB that are accessible "
"from both machines."
