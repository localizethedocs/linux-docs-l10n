"The AMDGPU driver includes a feature that enables automatic process "
"isolation on the graphics engine. This feature serializes access to the "
"graphics engine and adds a cleaner shader which clears the Local Data Store "
"(LDS) and General Purpose Registers (GPRs) between jobs. All processes using "
"the GPU, including both graphics and compute workloads, are serialized when "
"this feature is enabled. On GPUs that support partitionable graphics "
"engines, this feature can be enabled on a per-partition basis."

"In addition, there is an interface to manually run the cleaner shader when "
"the use of the GPU is complete. This may be preferable in some use cases, "
"such as a single-user system where the login manager triggers the cleaner "
"shader when the user logs out."

"The `enforce_isolation` file in sysfs can be used to enable process "
"isolation and automatic shader cleanup between processes. On GPUs that "
"support graphics engine partitioning, this can be enabled per partition. The "
"partition and its current setting (0 disabled, 1 enabled) can be read from "
"sysfs. On GPUs that do not support graphics engine partitioning, only a "
"single partition will be present. Writing 1 to the partition position "
"enables enforce isolation, writing 0 disables it."
