"The Faraday TV Encoder TVE200 is also known as the Gemini TV Interface "
"Controller (TVC) and is found in the Gemini Chipset from Storlink "
"Semiconductor (later Storm Semiconductor, later Cortina Systems) but also in "
"the Grain Media GM8180 chipset. On the Gemini the module is connected to 8 "
"data lines and a single clock line, comprising an 8-bit BT.656 interface."
