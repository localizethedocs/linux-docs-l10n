"Depending on the requirements for the para-virtualized environment, namely "
"requirements dictated by the accompanying DRM/(v)GPU drivers running in both "
"host and guest environments, display buffers can be allocated by either "
"frontend driver or backend."

"Note! If used with accompanying DRM/(v)GPU drivers this mode of operation "
"may require IOMMU support on the platform, so accompanying DRM/vGPU hardware "

msgid ""
"For systems which do not provide IOMMU support, but having specific "
"requirements for display buffers it is possible to allocate such buffers at "
"backend side and share those with the frontend. For example, if host domain "
"is 1:1 mapped and has DRM/GPU hardware expecting physically contiguous "
"memory, this allows implementing zero-copying use-cases."
