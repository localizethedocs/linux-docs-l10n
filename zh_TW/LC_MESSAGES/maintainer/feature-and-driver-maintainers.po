"The term \"maintainer\" spans a very wide range of levels of engagement from "
"people handling patches and pull requests as almost a full time job to "
"people responsible for a small feature or a driver."

"Unlike most of the chapter, this section is meant for the latter (more "
"populous) group. It provides tips and describes the expectations and "
"responsibilities of maintainers of a small(ish) section of the code."

"Drivers and alike most often do not have their own mailing lists and git "

"The amount of maintenance work is usually proportional to the size and "
"popularity of the code base. Small features and drivers should require "
"relatively small amount of care and feeding. Nonetheless when the work does "
"arrive (in form of patches which need review, user bug reports etc.) it has "
"to be acted upon promptly. Even when a particular driver only sees one patch "
"a month, or a quarter, a subsystem could well have a hundred such drivers. "
"Subsystem maintainers cannot afford to wait a long time to hear from "
"reviewers."

"The exact expectations on the response time will vary by subsystem. The "
"patch review SLA the subsystem had set for itself can sometimes be found in "
"the subsystem documentation. Failing that as a rule of thumb reviewers "
"should try to respond quicker than what is the usual patch review delay of "
"the subsystem maintainer. The resulting expectations may range from two "
"working days for fast-paced subsystems (e.g. networking) to as long as a few "
"weeks in slower moving parts of the kernel."

"Linux kernel uses mailing lists as the primary form of communication. "
"Maintainers must be subscribed and follow the appropriate subsystem-wide "

"When there are multiple maintainers for a piece of code an ``Acked-by`` or "

"Discussions about user reported issues, and development of new code should "

"development within a single company to be conducted behind closed doors. "
"However, development and discussions initiated by community members must not "
"be redirected from public to closed forums or to private email "
"conversations. Reasonable exceptions to this guidance include discussions "

"That said, being a maintainer is an active role. The MAINTAINERS file is not "
"a list of credits (in fact a separate CREDITS file exists), it is a list of "

"Modern best practices dictate that there should be at least two maintainers "

"Maintainers must be human, therefore, it is not acceptable to add a mailing "
