"This is a frame buffer device driver for 3dfx' Voodoo Graphics (aka voodoo "
"1, aka sst1) and Voodoo² (aka Voodoo 2, aka CVG) based video boards. It's "
"highly experimental code, but is guaranteed to work on my computer, with my "
"\"Maxi Gamer 3D\" and \"Maxi Gamer 3d²\" boards, and with me \"between chair "
"and keyboard\". Some people tested other combinations and it seems that it "
"works. The main page is located at <http://sstfb.sourceforge.net>, and if "
"you want the latest version, check out the CVS, as the driver is a work in "
"progress, I feel uncomfortable with releasing tarballs of something not "
"completely working...Don't worry, it's still more than usable (I eat my own "
"dog food)"

"This driver (should) work on ix86, with \"late\" 2.2.x kernel (tested with x "

"included in mainstream kernel since the infamous 2.4.10. You can apply the "
"patches found in `sstfb/kernel/*-2.{2|4}.x.patch`, and copy sstfb.c to linux/"
"drivers/video/, or apply a single patch, `sstfb/patch-2.{2|4}.x-sstfb-"
