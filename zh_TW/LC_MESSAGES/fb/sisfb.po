"sisfb is eg. useful if you want a high-resolution text console. Besides "
"that, sisfb is required to run DirectFB (which comes with an additional, "
"dedicated driver for the 315 series)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../fb/sisfb.rst:20
msgid ""
"On the 300 series, sisfb on kernels older than 2.6.3 furthermore plays an "
"important role in connection with DRM/DRI: Sisfb manages the memory heap "
"used by DRM/DRI for 3D texture and other data. This memory management is "
"required for using DRI/DRM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../fb/sisfb.rst:25
msgid ""
"Kernels >= around 2.6.3 do not need sisfb any longer for DRI/DRM memory "
"management. The SiS DRM driver has been updated and features a memory "
"manager of its own (which will be used if sisfb is not compiled). So unless "
"you want a graphical console, you don't need sisfb on kernels >=2.6.3."

"Well, it depends: If compiled statically into the kernel, use lilo's append "
"statement to add the parameters to the kernel command line. Please see "
"lilo's (or GRUB's) documentation for more information. If sisfb is a kernel "
"module, parameters are given with the modprobe (or insmod) command."

"A common mistake is that folks use a wrong parameter format when using the "
"driver compiled into the kernel. Please note: If compiled into the kernel, "
"the parameter format is video=sisfb:mode:none or video=sisfb:"
"mode:1024x768x16 (or whatever mode you want to use, alternatively using any "
"other format described above or the vesa keyword instead of mode). If "
"compiled as a module, the parameter format reads mode=none or "
"mode=1024x768x16 (or whatever mode you want to use). Using a \"=\" for a \":"
"\" (and vice versa) is a huge difference! Additionally: If you give more "
"than one argument to the in-kernel sisfb, the arguments are separated with "
"\",\". For example::"
