"Devices capable of offloading the kernel's datapath and perform functions "

"For example, a device acting as a multicast-aware bridge must be able to "
"send IGMP membership reports to the kernel for processing by the bridge "
"module. Without processing such packets, the bridge module could never "
"populate its MDB."

"As another example, consider a device acting as router which has received an "
"IP packet with a TTL of 1. Upon routing the packet the device must send it "
"to the kernel so that it will route it as well and generate an ICMP Time "
"Exceeded error datagram. Without letting the kernel route such packets "
"itself, utilities such as ``traceroute`` could never work."

"The ``devlink-trap`` mechanism allows capable device drivers to register "

msgid ""
"Upon receiving trapped packets, ``devlink`` will perform a per-trap packets "
"and bytes accounting and potentially report the packet to user space via a "
"netlink event along with all the provided metadata (e.g., trap reason, "
"timestamp, input port). This is especially useful for drop traps (see :ref:"
"`Trap-Types`) as it allows users to obtain further visibility into packet "
"drops that would otherwise be invisible."
