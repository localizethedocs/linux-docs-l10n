"The VXLAN protocol is a tunnelling protocol designed to solve the problem of "
"limited VLAN IDs (4096) in IEEE 802.1q.  With VXLAN the size of the "
"identifier is expanded to 24 bits (16777216)."

"VXLAN is described by IETF RFC 7348, and has been implemented by a number of "
"vendors.  The protocol runs over UDP using a single destination port.  This "
"document describes the Linux kernel tunnel device, there is also a separate "
"implementation of VXLAN for Openvswitch."

"Unlike most tunnels, a VXLAN is a 1 to N network, not just point to point. A "
"VXLAN device can learn the IP address of the other endpoint either "
"dynamically in a manner similar to a learning bridge, or make use of "
"statically-configured forwarding entries."

"The management of vxlan is done in a manner similar to its two closest "
"neighbors GRE and VLAN. Configuring VXLAN requires the version of iproute2 "
"that matches the kernel release where VXLAN was first merged upstream."

"This creates a new device named vxlan0.  The device uses the multicast group "
"239.1.1.1 over eth1 to handle traffic for which there is no entry in the "
"forwarding table.  The destination port number is set to the IANA-assigned "
"value of 4789.  The Linux implementation of VXLAN pre-dates the IANA's "
"selection of a standard destination port number and uses the Linux-selected "
"value by default to maintain backwards compatibility."
