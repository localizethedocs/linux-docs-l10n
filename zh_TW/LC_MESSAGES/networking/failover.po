"The failover module provides a generic interface for paravirtual drivers to "
"register a netdev and a set of ops with a failover instance. The ops are "
"used as event handlers that get called to handle netdev register/ unregister/"
"link change/name change events on slave pci ethernet devices with the same "
"mac address as the failover netdev."

"This enables paravirtual drivers to use a VF as an accelerated low latency "
"datapath. It also allows live migration of VMs with direct attached VFs by "
"failing over to the paravirtual datapath when the VF is unplugged."
