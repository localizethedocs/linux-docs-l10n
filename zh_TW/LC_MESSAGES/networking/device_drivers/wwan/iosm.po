"The IOSM (IPC over Shared Memory) driver is a WWAN PCIe host driver "
"developed for linux or chrome platform for data exchange over PCIe interface "
"between Host platform & Intel M.2 Modem. The driver exposes interface "
"conforming to the MBIM protocol [1]. Any front end application ( eg: Modem "
"Manager) could easily manage the MBIM interface to enable data communication "
"towards WWAN."
