"DEC FDDIcontroller 700 is DEC's first-generation TURBOchannel FDDI network "
"card, designed in 1990 specifically for the DECstation 5000 model 200 "
"workstation.  The board is a single attachment station and it was "
"manufactured in two variations, both of which are supported."

"First is the SAS MMF DEFZA-AA option, the original design implementing the "
"standard MMF-PMD, however with a pair of ST connectors rather than the usual "
"MIC connector.  The other one is the SAS ThinWire/STP DEFZA-CA option, "
"denoted 700-C, with the network medium selectable by a switch between the "
"DEC proprietary ThinWire-PMD using a BNC connector and the standard STP-PMD "
"using a DE-9F connector.  This option can interface to a DECconcentrator 500 "
"device and, in the case of the STP-PMD, also other FDDI equipment and was "
"designed to make it easier to transition from existing IEEE 802.3 10BASE2 "
"Ethernet and IEEE 802.5 Token Ring networks by providing means to reuse "
"existing cabling."

"This driver handles any number of cards installed in a single system. They "
"get fddi0, fddi1, etc. interface names assigned in the order of increasing "
"TURBOchannel slot numbers."

"The board only supports DMA on the receive side.  Transmission involves the "
"use of PIO.  As a result under a heavy transmission load there will be a "
"significant impact on system performance."

"The board supports a 64-entry CAM for matching destination addresses. Two "
"entries are preoccupied by the Directed Beacon and Ring Purger multicast "
"addresses and the rest is used as a multicast filter.  An all-multi mode is "
"also supported for LLC frames and it is used if requested explicitly or if "
"the CAM overflows.  The promiscuous mode supports separate enables for LLC "
"and SMT frames, but this driver doesn't support changing them individually."

"MAC address change.  The card does not support changing the Media Access "
"Controller's address registers but a similar effect can be achieved by "
"adding an alias to the CAM.  There is no way to disable matching against the "
"original address though."
