"This is the driver for the Altera Triple-Speed Ethernet (TSE) controllers "
"using the SGDMA and MSGDMA soft DMA IP components. The driver uses the "
"platform bus to obtain component resources. The designs used to test this "
"driver were built for a Cyclone(R) V SOC FPGA board, a Cyclone(R) V FPGA "
"board, and tested with ARM and NIOS processor hosts separately. The "
"anticipated use cases are simple communications between an embedded system "
"and an external peer for status and simple configuration of the embedded "
"system."
