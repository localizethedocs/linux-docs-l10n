"TC can be used for directing traffic to either a set of queues or to a "
"single queue on both the transmit and receive side."

"TC filter directing traffic to a set of queues is achieved using the action "
"skbedit priority for Tx priority selection, the priority maps to a traffic "

"TC filter directs traffic to a transmit queue with the action skbedit "

"is executed in software only and cannot be offloaded."

"TC flower filter directs incoming traffic to a set of queues using the "
"'hw_tc' option. hw_tc $TCID - Specify a hardware traffic class to pass "

"TC filter with action skbedit queue_mapping $rx_qid selects a receive queue. "
"The action skbedit queue_mapping for receive queue is supported only in "
"hardware. Multiple filters may compete in the hardware for queue selection. "
"In such case, the hardware pipeline resolves conflicts based on priority. On "
"Intel E810 devices, TC filter directing traffic to a queue have higher "
"priority over flow director filter assigning a queue. The hash filter has "
"lowest priority."
