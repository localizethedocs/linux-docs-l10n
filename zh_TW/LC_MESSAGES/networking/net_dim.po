"Dynamic Interrupt Moderation (DIM) (in networking) refers to changing the "
"interrupt moderation configuration of a channel in order to optimize packet "
"processing. The mechanism includes an algorithm which decides if and how to "
"change moderation parameters for a channel, usually by performing an "
"analysis on runtime data sampled from the system. Net DIM is such a "
"mechanism. In each iteration of the algorithm, it analyses a given sample of "
"the data, compares it to the previous sample and if required, it can decide "
"to change some of the interrupt moderation configuration fields. The data "
"sample is composed of data bandwidth, the number of packets and the number "
"of events. The time between samples is also measured. Net DIM compares the "
"current and the previous data and returns an adjusted interrupt moderation "
"configuration object. In some cases, the algorithm might decide not to "
"change anything. The configuration fields are the minimum duration "
"(microseconds) allowed between events and the maximum number of wanted "
"packets per event. The Net DIM algorithm ascribes importance to increase "
"bandwidth over reducing interrupt rate."

"The first two steps are straightforward, both the new and the previous data "
"are supplied by the driver registered to Net DIM. The previous data is the "
"new data supplied to the previous iteration. The comparison step checks the "
"difference between the new and previous data and decides on the result of "
"the last step. A step would result as \"better\" if bandwidth increases and "
"as \"worse\" if bandwidth reduces. If there is no change in bandwidth, the "
"packet rate is compared in a similar fashion - increase == \"better\" and "
"decrease == \"worse\". In case there is no change in the packet rate as "
"well, the interrupt rate is compared. Here the algorithm tries to optimize "
"for lower interrupt rate so an increase in the interrupt rate is considered "
"\"worse\" and a decrease is considered \"better\". Step #2 has an "
"optimization for avoiding false results: it only considers a difference "
"between samples as valid if it is greater than a certain percentage. Also, "
"since Net DIM does not measure anything by itself, it assumes the data "
"provided by the driver is valid."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/net_dim.rst:61
msgid ""
"Step #3 decides on the suggested configuration based on the result from step "
"#2 and the internal state of the algorithm. The states reflect the "
"\"direction\" of the algorithm: is it going left (reducing moderation), "
"right (increasing moderation) or standing still. Another optimization is "
"that if a decision to stay still is made multiple times, the interval "
"between iterations of the algorithm would increase in order to reduce "
"calculation overhead. Also, after \"parking\" on one of the most left or "
"most right decisions, the algorithm may decide to verify this decision by "
"taking a step in the other direction. This is done in order to avoid getting "
"stuck in a \"deep sleep\" scenario. Once a decision is made, an interrupt "
"moderation configuration is selected from the predefined profiles."

"Net DIM API exposes the main function net_dim(). This function is the entry "
"point to the Net DIM algorithm and has to be called every time the driver "
"would like to check if it should change interrupt moderation parameters. The "
"driver should provide two data structures: :c:type:`struct dim <dim>` and :c:"
"type:`struct dim_sample <dim_sample>`. :c:type:`struct dim <dim>` describes "
"the state of DIM for a specific object (RX queue, TX queue, other queues, "
"etc.). This includes the current selected profile, previous data samples, "
"the callback function provided by the driver and more. :c:type:`struct "
"dim_sample <dim_sample>` describes a data sample, which will be compared to "
"the data sample stored in :c:type:`struct dim <dim>` in order to decide on "

"In order to use Net DIM from a networking driver, the driver needs to call "

"to skip iterations under certain conditions, there is no need to moderate "
"the net_dim() calls as well. As mentioned above, the driver needs to provide "
"an object of type :c:type:`struct dim <dim>` to the net_dim() function call. "
"It is advised for each entity using Net DIM to hold a :c:type:`struct dim "
"<dim>` as part of its data structure and use it as the main Net DIM API "
