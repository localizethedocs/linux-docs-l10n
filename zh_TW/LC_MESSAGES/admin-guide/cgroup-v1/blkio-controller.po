"cgroup subsys \"blkio\" implements the block io controller. There seems to "
"be a need of various kinds of IO control policies (like proportional BW, max "
"BW) both at leaf nodes as well as at intermediate nodes in a storage "
"hierarchy. Plan is to use the same cgroup based management interface for "
"blkio controller and based on user options switch IO policies in the "
