"Swap device has priority and that decides the order of it to be used. To "

"The current code uses a priority based list, swap_avail_list, to decide "
"which swap device to use and if multiple swap devices share the same "
"priority, they are used round robin. This change here replaces the single "
"global swap_avail_list with a per-numa-node list, i.e. for each numa node, "
"it sees its own priority based list of available swap devices. Swap device's "
"priority can be promoted on its matching node's swap_avail_list."

#: ../../../admin-guide/mm/swap_numa.rst:70
msgid ""
"The current swap device's priority is set as: user can set a >=0 value, or "
"the system will pick one starting from -1 then downwards. The priority value "
"in the swap_avail_list is the negated value of the swap device's due to "
"plist being sorted from low to high. The new policy doesn't change the "
"semantics for priority >=0 cases, the previous starting from -1 then "
"downwards now becomes starting from -2 then downwards and -1 is reserved as "
"the promoted value. So if multiple swap devices are attached to the same "
"node, they will all be promoted to priority -1 on that node's plist and will "
"be used round robin before any other swap devices."
