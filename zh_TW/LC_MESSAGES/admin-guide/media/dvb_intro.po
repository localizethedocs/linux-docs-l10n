"One significant difference between Digital TV and Analogue TV that the "
"unwary (like myself) should consider is that, although the component "
"structure of DVB-T cards are substantially similar to Analogue TV cards, "
"they function in substantially different ways."

"The purpose of an Analogue TV is to receive and display an Analogue "
"Television signal. An Analogue TV signal (otherwise known as composite "
"video) is an analogue encoding of a sequence of image frames (25 frames per "
"second in Europe) rasterised using an interlacing technique. Interlacing "
"takes two fields to represent one frame. Therefore, an Analogue TV card for "
"a PC has the following purpose:"

"The digital datastream from an Analogue TV card is generated by circuitry on "
"the card and is often presented uncompressed. For a PAL TV signal encoded at "
"a resolution of 768x576 24-bit color pixels over 25 frames per second - a "
"fair amount of data is generated and must be processed by the PC before it "
"can be displayed on the video monitor screen. Some Analogue TV cards for PCs "
"have onboard MPEG2 encoders which permit the raw digital data stream to be "
"presented to the PC in an encoded and compressed form - similar to the form "
"that is used in Digital TV."

"The significant difference between the two is that the tuner on the analogue "
"TV card spits out an Analogue signal, whereas the tuner on the digital TV "
"card spits out a compressed encoded digital datastream. As the signal is "
"already digitised, it is trivial to pass this datastream to the PC databus "
"with minimal additional processing and then extract the digital video and "
"audio datastreams passing them to the appropriate software or hardware for "
"decoding and viewing."
