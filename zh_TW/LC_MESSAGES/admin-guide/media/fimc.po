"The FIMC (Fully Interactive Mobile Camera) device available in Samsung SoC "
"Application Processors is an integrated camera host interface, color space "

"from LCD controller (FIMD) through the SoC internal writeback data path.  "
"There are multiple FIMC instances in the SoCs (up to 4), having slightly "
"different capabilities, like pixel alignment constraints, rotator "
"availability, LCD writeback support, etc. The driver is located at drivers/"
