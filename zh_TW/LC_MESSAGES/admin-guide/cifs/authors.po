"The author wishes to express his appreciation and thanks to: Andrew Tridgell "
"(Samba team) for his early suggestions about SMB/CIFS VFS improvements. "
"Thanks to IBM for allowing me time and test resources to pursue this "
"project, to Jim McDonough from IBM (and the Samba Team) for his help, to the "
"IBM Linux JFS team for explaining many esoteric Linux filesystem features. "
"Jeremy Allison of the Samba team has done invaluable work in adding the "
"server side of the original CIFS Unix extensions and reviewing and "
"implementing portions of the newer CIFS POSIX extensions into the Samba 3 "
"file server. Thank Dave Boutcher of IBM Rochester (author of the OS/400 smb/"
"cifs filesystem client) for proving years ago that very good smb/cifs "
"clients could be done on Unix-like operating systems.  Volker Lendecke, "
"Andrew Tridgell, Urban Widmark, John Newbigin and others for their work on "
"the Linux smbfs module.  Thanks to the other members of the Storage Network "
"Industry Association CIFS Technical Workgroup for their work specifying this "
"highly complex protocol and finally thanks to the Samba team for their "
"technical advice and encouragement."
