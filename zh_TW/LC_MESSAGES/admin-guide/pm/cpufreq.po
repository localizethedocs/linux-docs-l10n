"The majority of modern processors are capable of operating in a number of "
"different clock frequency and voltage configurations, often referred to as "
"Operating Performance Points or P-states (in ACPI terminology).  As a rule, "
"the higher the clock frequency and the higher the voltage, the more "
"instructions can be retired by the CPU over a unit of time, but also the "
"higher the clock frequency and the higher the voltage, the more energy is "
"consumed over a unit of time (or the more power is drawn) by the CPU in the "
"given P-state.  Therefore there is a natural tradeoff between the CPU "
"capacity (the number of instructions that can be executed over a unit of "
"time) and the power drawn by the CPU."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.rst:28
msgid ""
"In some situations it is desirable or even necessary to run the program as "
"fast as possible and then there is no reason to use any P-states different "
"from the highest one (i.e. the highest-performance frequency/voltage "
"configuration available).  In some other cases, however, it may not be "
"necessary to execute instructions so quickly and maintaining the highest "
"available CPU capacity for a relatively long time without utilizing it "
"entirely may be regarded as wasteful. It also may not be physically possible "
"to maintain maximum CPU capacity for too long for thermal or power supply "
"capacity reasons or similar.  To cover those cases, there are hardware "
"interfaces allowing CPUs to be switched between different frequency/voltage "
"configurations or (in the ACPI terminology) to be put into different P-"
"states."

"Typically, they are used along with algorithms to estimate the required CPU "
"capacity, so as to decide which P-states to put the CPUs into.  Of course, "
"since the utilization of the system generally changes over time, that has to "
"be done repeatedly on a regular basis.  The activity by which this happens "
"is referred to as CPU performance scaling or CPU frequency scaling (because "
"it involves adjusting the CPU clock frequency)."

"Scaling drivers talk to the hardware.  They provide scaling governors with "

"requested by scaling governors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/pm/cpufreq.rst:68
msgid ""
"In principle, all available scaling governors can be used with every scaling "
"driver.  That design is based on the observation that the information used "
"by performance scaling algorithms for P-state selection can be represented "
"in a platform-independent form in the majority of cases, so it should be "
"possible to use the same performance scaling algorithm implemented in "
"exactly the same way regardless of which scaling driver is used.  "
"Consequently, the same set of scaling governors should be suitable for every "
"supported platform."
msgstr ""

"However, that observation may not hold for performance scaling algorithms "
"based on information provided by the hardware itself, for example through "
"feedback registers, as that information is typically specific to the "
"hardware interface it comes from and may not be easily represented in an "
"abstract, platform-independent way.  For this reason, ``CPUFreq`` allows "
"scaling drivers to bypass the governor layer and implement their own "
"performance scaling algorithms.  That is done by the |intel_pstate| scaling "
