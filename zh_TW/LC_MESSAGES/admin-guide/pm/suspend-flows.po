"At least one global system-wide transition needs to be carried out for the "

"occur for this purpose, but the other sleep states, commonly referred to as "
"*system-wide suspend* (or simply *system suspend*) states, need only one."

"The kernel code flows associated with the suspend and resume transitions for "

"The :ref:`suspend-to-RAM <s2ram>` and :ref:`standby <standby>` sleep states "
"cannot be implemented without platform support and the difference between "
"them boils down to the platform-specific actions carried out by the suspend "
"and resume hooks that need to be provided by the platform driver to make "
"them available.  Apart from that, the suspend and resume code flows for "
"these sleep states are mostly identical, so they both together will be "
"referred to as *platform-dependent suspend* states in what follows."
