"The zoned loop block device driver (zloop) allows a user to create a zoned "
"block device using one regular file per zone as backing storage. This driver "
"does not directly control any hardware and uses read, write and truncate "
"operations to regular files of a file system to emulate a zoned block device."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/blockdev/zoned_loop.rst:23
msgid ""
"Using zloop, zoned block devices with a configurable capacity, zone size and "
"number of conventional zones can be created. The storage for each zone of "
"the device is implemented using a regular file with a maximum size equal to "
"the zone size. The size of a file backing a conventional zone is always "
"equal to the zone size. The size of a file backing a sequential zone "
"indicates the amount of data sequentially written to the file, that is, the "
"size of the file directly indicates the position of the write pointer of the "
"zone."

#: ../../../admin-guide/blockdev/zoned_loop.rst:31
msgid ""
"When resetting a sequential zone, its backing file size is truncated to "
"zero. Conversely, for a zone finish operation, the backing file is truncated "
"to the zone size. With this, the maximum capacity of a zloop zoned block "
"device created can be larger configured to be larger than the storage space "
"available on the backing file system. Of course, for such configuration, "
"writing more data than the storage space available on the backing file "
"system will result in write errors."

"The zoned loop block device driver implements a complete zone transition "
