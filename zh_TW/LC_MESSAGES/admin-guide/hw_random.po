"The hw_random framework is software that makes use of a special hardware "
"feature on your CPU or motherboard, a Random Number Generator (RNG).  The "
"software has two parts: a core providing the /dev/hwrng character device and "
"its sysfs support, plus a hardware-specific driver that plugs into that core."

"CHARACTER DEVICE.  Using the standard open() and read() system calls, you "
"can read random data from the hardware RNG device.  This data is NOT CHECKED "
"by any fitness tests, and could potentially be bogus (if the hardware is "
"faulty or has been tampered with).  Data is only output if the hardware "
"\"has-data\" flag is set, but nevertheless a security-conscious person would "
"run fitness tests on the data before assuming it is truly random."

"attributes, \"rng_available\" and \"rng_current\".  The \"rng_available\" "
"attribute lists the hardware-specific drivers available, while "
"\"rng_current\" lists the one which is currently connected to /dev/hwrng.  "
"If your system has more than one RNG available, you may change the one used "
"by writing a name from the list in \"rng_available\" into \"rng_current\"."
