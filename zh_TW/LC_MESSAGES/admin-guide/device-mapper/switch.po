"The device-mapper switch target creates a device that supports an arbitrary "
"mapping of fixed-size regions of I/O across a fixed set of paths.  The path "
"used for any specific region can be switched dynamically by sending the "
"target a message."

"Dell EqualLogic and some other iSCSI storage arrays use a distributed "
"frameless architecture.  In this architecture, the storage group consists of "
"a number of distinct storage arrays (\"members\") each having independent "
"controllers, disk storage and network adapters.  When a LUN is created it is "
"spread across multiple members.  The details of the spreading are hidden "
"from initiators connected to this storage system. The storage group exposes "
"a single target discovery portal, no matter how many members are being "
"used.  When iSCSI sessions are created, each session is connected to an eth "
"port on a single member.  Data to a LUN can be sent on any iSCSI session, "
"and if the blocks being accessed are stored on another member the I/O will "
"be forwarded as required.  This forwarding is invisible to the initiator.  "
"The storage layout is also dynamic, and the blocks stored on disk may be "
"moved from member to member as needed to balance the load."

"This architecture simplifies the management and configuration of both the "
"storage group and initiators.  In a multipathing configuration, it is "
"possible to set up multiple iSCSI sessions to use multiple network "
"interfaces on both the host and target to take advantage of the increased "
"network bandwidth.  An initiator could use a simple round robin algorithm to "
"send I/O across all paths and let the storage array members forward it as "
"necessary, but there is a performance advantage to sending data directly to "
"the correct member."

"A device-mapper table already lets you map different regions of a device "
"onto different targets.  However in this architecture the LUN is spread with "
"an address region size on the order of 10s of MBs, which means the resulting "
"table could have more than a million entries and consume far too much memory."

msgid ""
"The lower tier consists of a single dm multipath device for each member. "
"Each of these multipath devices contains the set of paths directly to the "
"array member in one priority group, and leverages existing path selectors to "
"load balance amongst these paths.  We also build a non-preferred priority "
"group containing paths to other array members for failover reasons."

"The upper tier consists of a single dm-switch device.  This device uses a "
"bitmap to look up the location of the I/O and choose the appropriate lower "
"tier device to route the I/O.  By using a bitmap we are able to use 4 bits "
"for each address range in a 16 member group (which is very large for us).  "
"This is a much denser representation than the dm table b-tree can achieve."
