"This enables/disables the use of discard/TRIM commands. The discard/TRIM "
"commands are sent to the underlying block device when blocks are freed. This "
"is useful for SSD devices and sparse/thinly-provisioned LUNs.  The FITRIM "
"ioctl command is also available together with the nodiscard option. The "
"value of minlen specifies the minimum blockcount, when a TRIM command to the "
"block device is considered useful. When no value is given to the discard "
"option, it defaults to 64 blocks, which means 256KiB in JFS. The minlen "
"value of discard overrides the minlen value given on an FITRIM ioctl()."
