"SRBDS is a hardware vulnerability that allows MDS Documentation/admin-guide/"
"hw-vuln/mds.rst techniques to infer values returned from special register "
"accesses.  Special register accesses are accesses to off core registers.  "
"According to Intel's evaluation, the special register reads that have a "
"security expectation of privacy are RDRAND, RDSEED and SGX EGETKEY."
