"Contrary to the *Video Overlay* interface the framebuffer is normally "
"implemented on the TV card and not the graphics card. On Linux it is "
"accessible as a framebuffer device (``/dev/fbN``). Given a V4L2 device, "
"applications can find the corresponding framebuffer device by calling the :"
"ref:`VIDIOC_G_FBUF <VIDIOC_G_FBUF>` ioctl. It returns, amongst other "
"information, the physical address of the framebuffer in the ``base`` field "
"of struct :c:type:`v4l2_framebuffer`. The framebuffer device ioctl "
"``FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO`` returns the same address in the ``smem_start`` field "
"of struct :c:type:`fb_fix_screeninfo`. The ``FBIOGET_FSCREENINFO`` ioctl and "
"struct :c:type:`fb_fix_screeninfo` are defined in the ``linux/fb.h`` header "

"A struct :c:type:`v4l2_window` defines the size of the source rectangle, its "

"the overlay. To get the current parameters applications set the ``type`` "

"`VIDIOC_TRY_FMT <VIDIOC_G_FMT>` ioctl can be used to learn about driver "
