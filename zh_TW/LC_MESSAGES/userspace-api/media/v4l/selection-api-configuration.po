"Video hardware can have various cropping, composing and scaling limitations. "
"It may only scale up or down, support only discrete scaling factors, or have "
"different scaling abilities in the horizontal and vertical directions. Also "
"it may not support scaling at all. At the same time the cropping/composing "
"rectangles may have to be aligned, and both the source and the sink may have "
"arbitrary upper and lower size limits. Therefore, as usual, drivers are "
"expected to adjust the requested parameters and return the actual values "
"selected. An application can control the rounding behaviour using :ref:"
"`constraint flags <v4l2-selection-flags>`."
