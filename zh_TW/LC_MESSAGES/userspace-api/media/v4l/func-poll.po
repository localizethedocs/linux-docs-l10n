"On success :c:func:`poll()` returns the number of file descriptors that have "
"been selected (that is, file descriptors for which the ``revents`` field of "
"the respective ``struct pollfd`` structure is non-zero). Capture devices set "
"the ``POLLIN`` and ``POLLRDNORM`` flags in the ``revents`` field, output "
"devices the ``POLLOUT`` and ``POLLWRNORM`` flags. When the function timed "
"out it returns a value of zero, on failure it returns -1 and the ``errno`` "
"variable is set appropriately. When the application did not call :ref:"
"`VIDIOC_STREAMON <VIDIOC_STREAMON>` the :c:func:`poll()` function succeeds, "
"but sets the ``POLLERR`` flag in the ``revents`` field. When the application "
"has called :ref:`VIDIOC_STREAMON <VIDIOC_STREAMON>` for a capture device but "
"hasn't yet called :ref:`VIDIOC_QBUF <VIDIOC_QBUF>`, the :c:func:`poll()` "
"function succeeds and sets the ``POLLERR`` flag in the ``revents`` field. "
"For output devices this same situation will cause :c:func:`poll()` to "
"succeed as well, but it sets the ``POLLOUT`` and ``POLLWRNORM`` flags in the "
"``revents`` field."
