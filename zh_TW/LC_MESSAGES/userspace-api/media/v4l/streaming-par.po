"Streaming parameters are intended to optimize the video capture process as "
"well as I/O. Presently applications can request a high quality capture mode "
"with the :ref:`VIDIOC_S_PARM <VIDIOC_G_PARM>` ioctl."

"The current video standard determines a nominal number of frames per second. "
"If less than this number of frames is to be captured or output, applications "
"can request frame skipping or duplicating on the driver side. This is "
"especially useful when using the :c:func:`read()` or :c:func:`write()`, "
"which are not augmented by timestamps or sequence counters, and to avoid "
"unnecessary data copying."

"Finally these ioctls can be used to determine the number of buffers used "
"internally by a driver in read/write mode. For implications see the section "
"discussing the :c:func:`read()` function."

"To get and set the streaming parameters applications call the :ref:"
"`VIDIOC_G_PARM <VIDIOC_G_PARM>` and :ref:`VIDIOC_S_PARM <VIDIOC_G_PARM>` "
"ioctl, respectively. They take a pointer to a struct :c:type:"
"`v4l2_streamparm`, which contains a union holding separate parameters for "
"input and output devices."

"These ioctls are optional, drivers need not implement them. If so, they "
"return the ``EINVAL`` error code."
