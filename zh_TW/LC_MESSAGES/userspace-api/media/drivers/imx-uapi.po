"The adv718x decoders can occasionally send corrupt fields during NTSC/PAL "
"signal re-sync (too little or too many video lines). When this happens, the "
"IPU triggers a mechanism to re-establish vertical sync by adding 1 dummy "
"line every frame, which causes a rolling effect from image to image, and can "
"last a long time before a stable image is recovered. Or sometimes the "
"mechanism doesn't work at all, causing a permanent split image (one frame "
"contains lines from two consecutive captured images)."

"From experiment it was found that during image rolling, the frame intervals "
"(elapsed time between two EOF's) drop below the nominal value for the "
"current standard, by about one frame time (60 usec), and remain at that "
"value until rolling stops."

"While the reason for this observation isn't known (the IPU dummy line "
"mechanism should show an increase in the intervals by 1 line time every "
"frame, not a fixed value), we can use it to detect the corrupt fields using "
"a frame interval monitor. If the FIM detects a bad frame interval, the "
"ipuX_csiY subdev will send the event V4L2_EVENT_IMX_FRAME_INTERVAL_ERROR. "
"Userland can register with the FIM event notification on the ipuX_csiY "
"subdev device node. Userland can issue a streaming restart when this event "
"is received to correct the rolling/split image."
