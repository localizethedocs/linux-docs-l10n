"The example code provided for the symmetric key cipher operation applies "

"the aead_request_set_ad function must be used to set the pointer to the "
"associated data memory location before performing the encryption or "
"decryption operation. Another deviation from the asynchronous block cipher "
"operation is that the caller should explicitly check for -EBADMSG of the "
"crypto_aead_decrypt. That error indicates an authentication error, i.e. a "
