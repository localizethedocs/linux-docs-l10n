"This file documents the \"PC Beep Hidden Register\", which is present in "
"certain Realtek HDA codecs and controls a muxer and pair of passthrough "
"mixers that can route audio between pins but aren't themselves exposed as "
"HDA widgets. As far as I can tell, these hidden routes are designed to allow "
"flexible PC Beep output for codecs that don't have mixer widgets in their "
"output paths. Why it's easier to hide a mixer behind an undocumented vendor "
"register than to just expose it as a widget, I have no idea."

"All Realtek HDA codecs have a vendor-defined widget with node ID 20h which "
"provides access to a bank of registers that control various codec functions. "
"Registers are read and written via the standard HDA processing coefficient "
"verbs (Set/Get Coefficient Index, Set/Get Processing Coefficient). The node "
"is named \"Realtek Vendor Registers\" in public datasheets' verb listings "
"and, apart from that, is entirely undocumented."

"This particular register, exposed at coefficient 0x36 and named in commits "
"from Realtek, is of note: unlike most registers, which seem to control "
"detailed amplifier parameters not in scope of the HDA specification, it "
"controls audio routing which could just as easily have been defined using "
"standard HDA mixer and selector widgets."

"Specifically, it selects between two sources for the input pin widget with "
"Node ID (NID) 1Ah: the widget's signal can come either from an audio jack "
"(on my laptop, a Dell XPS 13 9350, it's the headphone jack, but comments in "
"Realtek commits indicate that it might be a Line In on some machines) or "
"from the PC Beep line (which is itself multiplexed between the codec's "
"internal beep generator and external PCBEEP pin, depending on if the beep "
"generator is enabled via verbs on NID 01h). Additionally, it can mix (with "
"optional amplification) that signal onto the 21h and/or 14h output pins."

"The register's reset value is 0x3717, corresponding to PC Beep on 1Ah that "
"is then amplified and mixed into both the headphones and the speakers. Not "
"only does this violate the HDA specification, which says that \"[a vendor "
"defined beep input pin] connection may be maintained *only* while the Link "
"reset (**RST#**) is asserted\", it means that we cannot ignore the register "
"if we care about the input that 1Ah would otherwise expose or if the PCBEEP "
"trace is poorly shielded and picks up chassis noise (both of which are the "
"case on my machine)."

"Unfortunately, there are lots of ways to get this register configuration "
"wrong. Linux, it seems, has gone through most of them. For one, the register "
"resets after S3 suspend: judging by existing code, this isn't the case for "
"all vendor registers, and it's led to some fixes that improve behavior on "
"cold boot but don't last after suspend. Other fixes have successfully "
"switched the 1Ah input away from PC Beep but have failed to disable both "
"loopback paths. On my machine, this means that the headphone input is "
"amplified and looped back to the headphone output, which uses the exact same "
"pins! As you might expect, this causes terrible headphone noise, the "
"character of which is controlled by the 1Ah boost control. (If you've seen "
"instructions online to fix XPS 13 headphone noise by changing \"Headphone "
"Mic Boost\" in ALSA, now you know why.)"

"The information here has been obtained through black-box reverse engineering "
"of the ALC256 codec's behavior and is not guaranteed to be correct. It "
"likely also applies for the ALC255, ALC257, ALC235, and ALC236, since those "
"codecs seem to be close relatives of the ALC256. (They all share one "
"initialization function.) Additionally, other codecs like the ALC225 and "
"ALC285 also have this register, judging by existing fixups in "
"``patch_realtek.c``, but specific data (e.g. node IDs, bit positions, pin "
"mappings) for those codecs may differ from what I've described here."
