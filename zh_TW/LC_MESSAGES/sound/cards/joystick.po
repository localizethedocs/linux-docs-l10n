"The joystick support of ALSA drivers is different between ISA and PCI "
"cards.  In the case of ISA (PnP) cards, it's usually handled by the "
"independent module (ns558).  Meanwhile, the ALSA PCI drivers have the built-"
"in gameport support.  Hence, when the ALSA PCI driver is built in the "
"kernel, CONFIG_GAMEPORT must be 'y', too.  Otherwise, the gameport support "
"on that card will be (silently) disabled."

"For PCI cards, the joystick is enabled when the appropriate module option is "
"specified.  Some drivers don't need options, and the joystick support is "
"always enabled.  In the former ALSA version, there was a dynamic control API "
"for the joystick activation.  It was changed, however, to the static module "
"options because of the system stability and the resource management."
