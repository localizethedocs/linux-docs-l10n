"In Roland Soundcanvas mode, multiple ALSA raw MIDI substreams are supported "
"(midiCnD0-midiCnD15).  Whenever you write to a different substream, the "
"driver sends the nonstandard MIDI command sequence F5 NN, where NN is the "
"substream number plus 1.  Roland modules use this command to switch between "
"different \"parts\", so this feature lets you treat each part as a distinct "
"raw MIDI substream. The driver provides no way to send F5 00 (no selection) "
"or to not send the F5 NN command sequence at all; perhaps it ought to."

"In MS-124W M/B mode, the driver supports 16 ALSA raw MIDI substreams; the "
"outs module parameter is automatically set to 16.  The substream number "
"gives a bitmask of which MIDI Out connectors the data should be sent to, "
"with midiCnD1 sending to Out 1, midiCnD2 to Out 2, midiCnD4 to Out 3, and "
"midiCnD8 to Out 4.  Thus midiCnD15 sends the data to all 4 ports. As a "
"special case, midiCnD0 also sends to all ports, since it is not useful to "
"send the data to no ports.  M/B mode has extra overhead to select the MIDI "
"Out for each byte, so the aggregate data rate across all four MIDI Outs is "
"at most one byte every 520 us, as compared with the full MIDI data rate of "
"one byte every 320 us per port."

"The MS-124W hardware's M/A mode is currently not supported. This mode allows "
"the MIDI Outs to act independently at double the aggregate throughput of M/"
"B, but does not allow sending the same byte simultaneously to multiple MIDI "
"Outs. The M/A protocol requires the driver to twiddle the modem control "
"lines under timing constraints, so it would be a bit more complicated to "
"implement than the other modes."

"Midiator models other than MS-124W and MS-124T are currently not supported. "

"compatible, nor are the other known models MS-101, MS-101B, MS-103, and "
"MS-114. I do have documentation (tim.mann@compaq.com) that partially covers "
"these models, but no units to experiment with.  The MS-124W support is "
"tested with a real unit. The MS-124T support is untested, but should work."

"The Generic driver supports multiple input and output substreams over a "
