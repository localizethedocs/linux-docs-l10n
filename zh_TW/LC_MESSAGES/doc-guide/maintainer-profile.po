"The documentation \"subsystem\" is the central coordinating point for the "
"kernel's documentation and associated infrastructure.  It covers the "
"hierarchy under Documentation/ (with the exception of Documentation/"
"devicetree), various utilities under scripts/ and, at least some of the "
"time, LICENSES/."

"It's worth noting, though, that the boundaries of this subsystem are rather "
"fuzzier than normal.  Many other subsystem maintainers like to keep control "
"of portions of Documentation/, and many more freely apply changes there when "
"it is convenient.  Beyond that, much of the kernel's documentation is found "
"in the source as kerneldoc comments; those are usually (but not always) "
"maintained by the relevant subsystem maintainer."

"When making documentation changes, you should actually build the "
"documentation and ensure that no new errors or warnings have been "
"introduced.  Generating HTML documents and looking at the result will help "
"to avoid unsightly misunderstandings about how things will be rendered."

"All new documentation (including additions to existing documents) should "
"ideally justify who the intended target audience is somewhere in the "
"changelog; this way, we ensure that the documentation ends up in the correct "
"place.  Some possible categories are: kernel developers (experts or "
"beginners), userspace programmers, end users and/or system administrators, "
"and distributors."

"Patches can be sent anytime, but response will be slower than usual during "

"I am the sole maintainer for the documentation subsystem, and I am doing the "
"work on my own time, so the response to patches will occasionally be slow.  "
"I try to always send out a notification when a patch is merged (or when I "
"decide that one cannot be).  Do not hesitate to send a ping if you have not "
"heard back within a week of sending a patch."
