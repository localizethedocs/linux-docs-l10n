"zonefs is a very simple file system exposing each zone of a zoned block "
"device as a file. Unlike a regular POSIX-compliant file system with native "
"zoned block device support (e.g. f2fs), zonefs does not hide the sequential "
"write constraint of zoned block devices to the user. Files representing "
"sequential write zones of the device must be written sequentially starting "
"from the end of the file (append only writes)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/zonefs.rst:17
msgid ""
"As such, zonefs is in essence closer to a raw block device access interface "
"than to a full-featured POSIX file system. The goal of zonefs is to simplify "
"the implementation of zoned block device support in applications by "
"replacing raw block device file accesses with a richer file API, avoiding "
"relying on direct block device file ioctls which may be more obscure to "
"developers. One example of this approach is the implementation of LSM (log-"
"structured merge) tree structures (such as used in RocksDB and LevelDB) on "
"zoned block devices by allowing SSTables to be stored in a zone file "
"similarly to a regular file system rather than as a range of sectors of the "
"entire disk. The introduction of the higher level construct \"one file is "
"one zone\" can help reducing the amount of changes needed in the application "
"as well as introducing support for different application programming "
"languages."

"sequential zone cannot be overwritten. Sequential zones must first be erased "
