"Quota subsystem allows system administrator to set limits on used space and "
"number of used inodes (inode is a filesystem structure which is associated "
"with each file or directory) for users and/or groups. For both used space "
"and number of used inodes there are actually two limits. The first one is "
"called softlimit and the second one hardlimit.  A user can never exceed a "
"hardlimit for any resource (unless he has CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability). User "
"is allowed to exceed softlimit but only for limited period of time. This "
"period is called \"grace period\" or \"grace time\". When grace time is "
"over, user is not able to allocate more space/inodes until he frees enough "
"of them to get below softlimit."

"When user exceeds a softlimit, runs out of grace time or reaches hardlimit, "
"quota subsystem traditionally printed a message to the controlling terminal "
"of the process which caused the excess. This method has the disadvantage "
"that when user is using a graphical desktop he usually cannot see the "
"message. Thus quota netlink interface has been designed to pass information "
"about the above events to userspace. There they can be captured by an "
"application and processed accordingly."

"The interface uses generic netlink framework (see https://lwn.net/"
"Articles/208755/ and http://www.infradead.org/~tgr/libnl/ for more details "
"about this layer). The name of the quota generic netlink interface is "
"\"VFS_DQUOT\". Definitions of constants below are in <linux/quota.h>.  Since "
"the quota netlink protocol is not namespace aware, quota netlink messages "
"are sent only in initial network namespace."
