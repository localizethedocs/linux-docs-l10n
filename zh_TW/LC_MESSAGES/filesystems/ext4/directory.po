"In an ext4 filesystem, a directory is more or less a flat file that maps an "
"arbitrary byte string (usually ASCII) to an inode number on the filesystem. "
"There can be many directory entries across the filesystem that reference the "
"same inode number--these are known as hard links, and that is why hard links "
"cannot reference files on other filesystems. As such, directory entries are "
"found by reading the data block(s) associated with a directory file for the "
"particular directory entry that is desired."

"By default, each directory lists its entries in an “almost-linear” array. I "
"write “almost” because it's not a linear array in the memory sense because "
"directory entries are not split across filesystem blocks. Therefore, it is "
"more accurate to say that a directory is a series of data blocks and that "
"each block contains a linear array of directory entries. The end of each per-"
"block array is signified by reaching the end of the block; the last entry in "
"the block has a record length that takes it all the way to the end of the "
"block. The end of the entire directory is of course signified by reaching "
"the end of the file. Unused directory entries are signified by inode = 0. By "
"default the filesystem uses ``struct ext4_dir_entry_2`` for directory "
"entries unless the “filetype” feature flag is not set, in which case it uses "
"``struct ext4_dir_entry``."
