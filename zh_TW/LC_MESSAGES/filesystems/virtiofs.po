"The virtiofs file system for Linux implements a driver for the "
"paravirtualized VIRTIO \"virtio-fs\" device for guest<->host file system "
"sharing.  It allows a guest to mount a directory that has been exported on "
"the host."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/virtiofs.rst:17
msgid ""
"Guests often require access to files residing on the host or remote systems. "
"Use cases include making files available to new guests during installation, "
"booting from a root file system located on the host, persistent storage for "
"stateless or ephemeral guests, and sharing a directory between guests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/virtiofs.rst:22
msgid ""
"Although it is possible to use existing network file systems for some of "
"these tasks, they require configuration steps that are hard to automate and "
"they expose the storage network to the guest.  The virtio-fs device was "
"designed to solve these problems by providing file system access without "
"networking."

"Furthermore the virtio-fs device takes advantage of the co-location of the "
"guest and host to increase performance and provide semantics that are not "
"possible with network file systems."

"The atime-related mount options, for example, noatime, strictatime, are "

msgid ""
"Since the virtio-fs device uses the FUSE protocol for file system requests, "
"the virtiofs file system for Linux is integrated closely with the FUSE file "
"system client.  The guest acts as the FUSE client while the host acts as the "
"FUSE server.  The /dev/fuse interface between the kernel and userspace is "
"replaced with the virtio-fs device interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/virtiofs.rst:64
msgid ""
"FUSE requests are placed into a virtqueue and processed by the host.  The "
"response portion of the buffer is filled in by the host and the guest "
"handles the request completion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/virtiofs.rst:68
msgid ""
"Mapping /dev/fuse to virtqueues requires solving differences in semantics "
"between /dev/fuse and virtqueues.  Each time the /dev/fuse device is read, "
"the FUSE client may choose which request to transfer, making it possible to "
"prioritize certain requests over others.  Virtqueues have queue semantics "
"and it is not possible to change the order of requests that have been "
"enqueued. This is especially important if the virtqueue becomes full since "
"it is then impossible to add high priority requests.  In order to address "
"this difference, the virtio-fs device uses a \"hiprio\" virtqueue "
"specifically for requests that have priority over normal requests."
