"Kernel Electric-Fence (KFENCE) is a low-overhead sampling-based memory "

"KFENCE is designed to be enabled in production kernels, and has near zero "
"performance overhead. Compared to KASAN, KFENCE trades performance for "
"precision. The main motivation behind KFENCE's design, is that with enough "
"total uptime KFENCE will detect bugs in code paths not typically exercised "
"by non-production test workloads. One way to quickly achieve a large enough "
"total uptime is when the tool is deployed across a large fleet of machines."

"The most important parameter is KFENCE's sample interval, which can be set "

"Guarded allocations are set up based on the sample interval. After "

"When using ``CONFIG_KFENCE_STATIC_KEYS=y``, KFENCE allocations are \"gated\" "

"system architecture, this may perform better than the simple dynamic branch. "
"Careful benchmarking is recommended."

"KFENCE objects each reside on a dedicated page, at either the left or right "
"page boundaries selected at random. The pages to the left and right of the "
"object page are \"guard pages\", whose attributes are changed to a protected "
"state, and cause page faults on any attempted access. Such page faults are "
"then intercepted by KFENCE, which handles the fault gracefully by reporting "
"an out-of-bounds access, and marking the page as accessible so that the "
"faulting code can (wrongly) continue executing (set ``panic_on_warn`` to "
"panic instead)."

"To detect out-of-bounds writes to memory within the object's page itself, "
"KFENCE also uses pattern-based redzones. For each object page, a redzone is "
"set up for all non-object memory. For typical alignments, the redzone is "
"only required on the unguarded side of an object. Because KFENCE must honor "
"the cache's requested alignment, special alignments may result in "
"unprotected gaps on either side of an object, all of which are redzoned."

"Upon deallocation of a KFENCE object, the object's page is again protected "

"fault and KFENCE reports a use-after-free access. Freed objects are inserted "

"If pool utilization reaches 75% (default) or above, to reduce the risk of "

"diverse coverage of allocations, KFENCE limits currently covered allocations "
"of the same source from further filling up the pool. The \"source\" of an "
"allocation is based on its partial allocation stack trace. A side-effect is "
"that this also limits frequent long-lived allocations (e.g. pagecache) of "
"the same source filling up the pool permanently, which is the most common "
"risk for the pool becoming full and the sampled allocation rate dropping to "
"zero. The threshold at which to start limiting currently covered allocations "
