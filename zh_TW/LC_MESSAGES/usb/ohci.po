"The \"ohci-hcd\" driver is a USB Host Controller Driver (HCD) that is "
"derived from the \"usb-ohci\" driver from the 2.4 kernel series.  The \"usb-"
"ohci\" code was written primarily by Roman Weissgaerber <weissg@vienna.at> "
"but with contributions from many others (read its copyright/licencing "
"header)."

"It supports the \"Open Host Controller Interface\" (OHCI), which "
"standardizes hardware register protocols used to talk to USB 1.1 host "
"controllers.  As compared to the earlier \"Universal Host Controller "
"Interface\" (UHCI) from Intel, it pushes more intelligence into the "
"hardware.  USB 1.1 controllers from vendors other than Intel and VIA "
"generally use OHCI."

"The \"ohci-hcd\" driver handles all USB 1.1 transfer types.  Transfers of "
"all types can be queued.  That was also true in \"usb-ohci\", except for "
"interrupt transfers.  Previously, using periods of one frame would risk data "
"loss due to overhead in IRQ processing.  When interrupt transfers are "
"queued, those risks can be minimized by making sure the hardware always has "
"transfers to work on while the OS is getting around to the relevant IRQ "
"processing."
