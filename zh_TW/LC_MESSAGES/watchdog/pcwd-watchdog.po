"The PC Watchdog is a card that offers the same type of functionality that "
"the WDT card does, only it doesn't require an IRQ to run.  Furthermore, the "
"Revision C card allows you to monitor any IO Port to automatically trigger "
"the card into being reset.  This way you can make the card monitor hard "
"drive status, or anything else you need."
