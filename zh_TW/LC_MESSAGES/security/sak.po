"An operating system's Secure Attention Key is a security tool which is "
"provided as protection against trojan password capturing programs.  It is an "
"undefeatable way of killing all programs which could be masquerading as "
"login applications.  Users need to be taught to enter this key sequence "
"before they log in to the system."

"From the PC keyboard, Linux has two similar but different ways of providing "
"SAK.  One is the ALT-SYSRQ-K sequence.  You shouldn't use this sequence.  It "
"is only available if the kernel was compiled with sysrq support."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security/sak.rst:19
msgid ""
"The proper way of generating a SAK is to define the key sequence using "
"``loadkeys``.  This will work whether or not sysrq support is compiled into "
"the kernel."

"SAK works correctly when the keyboard is in raw mode.  This means that once "
"defined, SAK will kill a running X server.  If the system is in run level 5, "
"the X server will restart.  This is what you want to happen."

"What key sequence should you use? Well, CTRL-ALT-DEL is used to reboot the "
"machine.  CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE is magical to the X server.  We'll choose CTRL-"

"These commands cause **all** daemons which are launched by the initscripts "

"system management applications to malfunction - test everything well."
