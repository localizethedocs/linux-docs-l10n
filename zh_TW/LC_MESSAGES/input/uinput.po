"uinput is a kernel module that makes it possible to emulate input devices "
"from userspace. By writing to /dev/uinput (or /dev/input/uinput) device, a "
"process can create a virtual input device with specific capabilities. Once "
"this virtual device is created, the process can send events through it, that "
"will be delivered to userspace and in-kernel consumers."

"libevdev is a wrapper library for evdev devices that provides interfaces to "
"create uinput devices and send events. libevdev is less error-prone than "
"accessing uinput directly, and should be considered for new software."

"Before uinput version 5, there wasn't a dedicated ioctl to set up a virtual "
"device. Programs supporting older versions of uinput interface need to fill "
"a uinput_user_dev structure and write it to the uinput file descriptor to "
"configure the new uinput device. New code should not use the old interface "
"but interact with uinput via ioctl calls, or use libevdev."
