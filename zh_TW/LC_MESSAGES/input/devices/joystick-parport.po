"The joystick parport drivers are used for joysticks and gamepads not "
"originally designed for PCs and other computers Linux runs on. Because of "
"that, PCs usually lack the right ports to connect these devices to. Parallel "
"port, because of its ability to change single bits at will, and providing "
"both output and input bits is the most suitable port on the PC for "
"connecting such devices."

"The main problem with PC parallel ports is that they don't have +5V power "
