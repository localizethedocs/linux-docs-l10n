"Currently the ALPS touchpad driver supports seven protocol versions in use "

"Since roughly mid-2010 several new ALPS touchpads have been released and "
"integrated into a variety of laptops and netbooks.  These new touchpads have "
"enough behavior differences that the alps_model_data definition table, "
"describing the properties of the different versions, is no longer adequate.  "
"The design choices were to re-define the alps_model_data table, with the "
"risk of regression testing existing devices, or isolate the new devices "
"outside of the alps_model_data table.  The latter design choice was made.  "
"The new touchpad signatures are named: \"Rushmore\", \"Pinnacle\", and "
"\"Dolphin\", which you will see in the alps.c code. For the purposes of this "
"document, this group of ALPS touchpads will generically be called \"new ALPS "
"touchpads\"."

"We experimented with probing the ACPI interface _HID (Hardware ID)/_CID "
"(Compatibility ID) definition as a way to uniquely identify the different "
"ALPS variants but there did not appear to be a 1:1 mapping. In fact, it "
"appeared to be an m:n mapping between the _HID and actual hardware type."

msgid ""
"All ALPS touchpads should respond to the \"E6 report\" command sequence: E8-"
"E6-E6-E6-E9. An ALPS touchpad should respond with either 00-00-0A or "
"00-00-64 if no buttons are pressed. The bits 0-2 of the first byte will be "
"1s if some buttons are pressed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../input/devices/alps.rst:36
msgid ""
"If the E6 report is successful, the touchpad model is identified using the "
"\"E7 report\" sequence: E8-E7-E7-E7-E9. The response is the model signature "
"and is matched against known models in the alps_model_data_array."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For older touchpads supporting protocol versions 3 and 4, the E7 report "
"model signature is always 73-02-64. To differentiate between these versions, "
"the response from the \"Enter Command Mode\" sequence must be inspected as "
"described below."

"The new ALPS touchpads have an E7 signature of 73-03-50 or 73-03-0A but seem "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Protocol versions 3 and 4 have a command mode that is used to read and write "
"one-byte device registers in a 16-bit address space. The command sequence EC-"
"EC-EC-E9 places the device in command mode, and the device will respond with "
"88-07 followed by a third byte. This third byte can be used to determine "
"whether the devices uses the version 3 or 4 protocol."

"To exit command mode, PSMOUSE_CMD_SETSTREAM (EA) is sent to the touchpad."

"While in command mode, register addresses can be set by first sending a "
"specific command, either EC for v3 devices or F5 for v4 devices. Then the "
"address is sent one nibble at a time, where each nibble is encoded as a "
"command with optional data. This encoding differs slightly between the v3 "
"and v4 protocols."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../input/devices/alps.rst:65
msgid ""
"Once an address has been set, the addressed register can be read by sending "
"PSMOUSE_CMD_GETINFO (E9). The first two bytes of the response contains the "
"address of the register being read, and the third contains the value of the "
"register. Registers are written by writing the value one nibble at a time "
"using the same encoding used for addresses."

msgid ""
"For the new ALPS touchpads, the EC command is used to enter command mode. "
"The response in the new ALPS touchpads is significantly different, and more "
"important in determining the behavior.  This code has been separated from "
"the original alps_model_data table and put in the alps_identify function.  "
"For example, there seem to be two hardware init sequences for the "
"\"Dolphin\" touchpads as determined by the second byte of the EC response."
