"The edt-ft5x06 driver is useful for the EDT \"Polytouch\" family of "
"capacitive touch screens. Note that it is *not* suitable for other devices "
"based on the focaltec ft5x06 devices, since they contain vendor-specific "
"firmware. In particular this driver is not suitable for the Nook tablet."
