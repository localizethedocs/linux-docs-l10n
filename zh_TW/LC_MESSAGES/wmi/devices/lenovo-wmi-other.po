"The Other Mode WMI interface uses the firmware_attributes class to expose "
"various WMI attributes provided by the interface in the sysfs. This enables "
"CPU and GPU power limit tuning as well as various other attributes for "
"devices that fall under the \"Gaming Series\" of Lenovo devices. Each "
"attribute exposed by the Other Mode interface has corresponding capability "
"data blocks which allow the driver to probe details about the attribute. "
"Each attribute has multiple pages, one for each of the platform profiles "
"managed by the Gamezone interface. Attributes are exposed in sysfs under the "
