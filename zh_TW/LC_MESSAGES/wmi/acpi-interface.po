"The ACPI WMI interface is a proprietary extension of the ACPI specification "
"made by Microsoft to allow hardware vendors to embed WMI (Windows Management "
"Instrumentation) objects inside their ACPI firmware. Typical functions "
"implemented over ACPI WMI are hotkey events on modern notebooks and "
"configuration of BIOS options."

"Discovery of WMI objects is handled by defining ACPI devices with a PNP ID "
"of ``PNP0C14``. These devices will contain a set of ACPI buffers and methods "
"used for mapping and execution of WMI methods and/or queries. If there exist "
"multiple of such devices, then each device is required to have a unique ACPI "
