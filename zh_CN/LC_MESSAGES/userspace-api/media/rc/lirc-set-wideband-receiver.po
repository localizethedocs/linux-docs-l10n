msgid ""
"Some receivers are equipped with special wide band receiver which is "
"intended to be used to learn output of existing remote. This ioctl allows "
"enabling or disabling it."

"This might be useful of receivers that have otherwise narrow band receiver "
"that prevents them to be used with some remotes. Wide band receiver might "
"also be more precise. On the other hand its disadvantage it usually reduced "
"range of reception."

"Wide band receiver might be implicitly enabled if you enable carrier "
"reports. In that case it will be disabled as soon as you disable carrier "
"reports. Trying to disable wide band receiver while carrier reports are "
"active will do nothing."
