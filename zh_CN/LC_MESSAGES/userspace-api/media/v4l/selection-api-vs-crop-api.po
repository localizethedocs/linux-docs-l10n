"The selection API was introduced to cope with deficiencies of the older :ref:"
"`CROP API <crop>`, that was designed to control simple capture devices. "
"Later the cropping API was adopted by video output drivers. The ioctls are "
"used to select a part of the display were the video signal is inserted. It "
"should be considered as an API abuse because the described operation is "
"actually the composing. The selection API makes a clear distinction between "
"composing and cropping operations by setting the appropriate targets."

msgid ""
"The CROP API lacks any support for composing to and cropping from an image "
"inside a memory buffer. The application could configure a capture device to "
"fill only a part of an image by abusing V4L2 API. Cropping a smaller image "
"from a larger one is achieved by setting the field ``bytesperline`` at "
"struct :c:type:`v4l2_pix_format`. Introducing an image offsets could be done "
"by modifying field ``m_userptr`` at struct :c:type:`v4l2_buffer` before "
"calling :ref:`VIDIOC_QBUF <VIDIOC_QBUF>`. Those operations should be avoided "
"because they are not portable (endianness), and do not work for macroblock "
"and Bayer formats and mmap buffers."

msgid ""
"The selection API deals with configuration of buffer cropping/composing in a "
"clear, intuitive and portable way. Next, with the selection API the concepts "
"of the padded target and constraints flags are introduced. Finally, struct :"
"c:type:`v4l2_crop` and struct :c:type:`v4l2_cropcap` have no reserved "
"fields. Therefore there is no way to extend their functionality. The new "
"struct :c:type:`v4l2_selection` provides a lot of place for future "
"extensions."

"Driver developers are encouraged to implement only selection API. The former "
