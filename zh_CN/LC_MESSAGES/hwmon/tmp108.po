"The Texas Instruments TMP108 implements one temperature sensor. An alert pin "
"can be set when temperatures exceed minimum or maximum values plus or minus "
"a hysteresis value. (This driver does not support interrupts for the alert "
"pin, and the device runs in comparator mode.)"

"The sensor is accurate to 0.75C over the range of -25 to +85 C, and to 1.0 "
"degree from -40 to +125 C. Resolution of the sensor is 0.0625 degree. The "
"operating temperature has a minimum of -55 C and a maximum of +150 C. "
"Hysteresis values can be set to 0, 1, 2, or 4C."

"By default the TMP108 reads the temperature continuously. To conserve power, "
"the TMP108 has a one-shot mode where the device is normally shut-down. When "
"a one shot is requested the temperature is read, the result can be "
"retrieved, and then the device is shut down automatically. (This driver only "
"supports continuous mode.)"
