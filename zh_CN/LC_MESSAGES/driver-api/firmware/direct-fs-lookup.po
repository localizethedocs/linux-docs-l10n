"Direct filesystem lookup is the most common form of firmware lookup "
"performed by the kernel. The kernel looks for the firmware directly on the "
"root filesystem in the paths documented in the section 'Firmware search "
"paths'. The filesystem lookup is implemented in "
"fw_get_filesystem_firmware(), it uses common core kernel file loader "
"facility kernel_read_file_from_path(). The max path allowed is PATH_MAX -- "
"currently this is 4096 characters."

"It is recommended you keep /lib/firmware paths on your root filesystem, "
"avoid having a separate partition for them in order to avoid possible races "
"with lookups and avoid uses of the custom fallback mechanisms documented "
"below."

"Drivers which are built-in to the kernel should have the firmware integrated "
"also as part of the initramfs used to boot the kernel given that otherwise a "
"race is possible with loading the driver and the real rootfs not yet being "
"available. Stuffing the firmware into initramfs resolves this race issue, "
"however note that using initrd does not suffice to address the same race."

msgid ""
"There are circumstances that justify not wanting to include firmware into "
"initramfs, such as dealing with large firmware files for the remote-proc "
"subsystem. For such cases using a userspace fallback mechanism is currently "
"the only viable solution as only userspace can know for sure when the real "
"rootfs is ready and mounted."
