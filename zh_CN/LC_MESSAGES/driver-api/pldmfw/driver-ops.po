"The ``.match_record`` operation is used to determine whether a given PLDM "
"record matches the device being updated. This requires comparing the record "
"descriptors in the record with information from the device. Many record "
"descriptors are defined by the PLDM standard, but it is also allowed for "
"devices to implement their own descriptors."

"The ``.send_package_data`` operation is used to send the device-specific "

"provides package data, ``pldmfw`` will call the ``.send_package_data`` "
"function with a pointer to the package data and with the package data "

"The ``.send_component_table`` operation is used to forward component "
"information to the device. It is called once for each applicable component, "
"that is, for each component indicated by the matching record. The device "
"driver should send the component information to the device firmware, and "
"wait for a response. The provided transfer flag indicates whether this is "
"the first, last, or a middle component, and is expected to be forwarded to "
"firmware as part of the component table information. The driver should an "
