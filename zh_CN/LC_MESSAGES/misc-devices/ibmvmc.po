"A logical device, called the Virtual Management Channel (VMC), is defined "
"for communicating between the management application and the hypervisor. It "
"basically creates the pipes that enable virtualization management software. "
"This device is presented to a designated management partition as a virtual "
"device."

"This communication device uses Command/Response Queue (CRQ) and the Remote "
"Direct Memory Access (RDMA) interfaces. A three-way handshake is defined "
"that must take place to establish that both the hypervisor and management "
"partition sides of the channel are running prior to sending/receiving any of "
"the protocol messages."

"This driver also utilizes Transport Event CRQs. CRQ messages are sent when "
"the hypervisor detects one of the peer partitions has abnormally terminated, "
"or one side has called H_FREE_CRQ to close their CRQ. Two new classes of CRQ "
"messages are introduced for the VMC device. VMC Administrative messages are "
"used for each partition using the VMC to communicate capabilities to their "
"partner. HMC Interface messages are used for the actual flow of HMC messages "
"between the management partition and the hypervisor. As most HMC messages "
"far exceed the size of a CRQ buffer, a virtual DMA (RMDA) of the HMC message "
"data is done prior to each HMC Interface CRQ message. Only the management "
"partition drives RDMA operations; hypervisors never directly cause the "
"movement of message data."

"This section provides an example for the management application "

"The device driver is responsible for initializing the VMC when the driver is "
"loaded. It first creates and initializes the CRQ. Next, an exchange of VMC "
"capabilities is performed to indicate the code version and number of "
"resources available in both the management partition and the hypervisor. "
"Finally, the hypervisor requests that the management partition create an "
"initial pool of VMC buffers, one buffer for each possible HMC connection, "
"which will be used for management application  session initialization. Prior "
"to completion of this initialization sequence, the device returns EBUSY to "
"open() calls. EIO is returned for all open() failures."

"After the basic VMC channel has been initialized, an HMC session level "
"connection can be established. The application layer performs an open() to "
"the VMC device and executes an ioctl() against it, indicating the HMC ID (32 "
"bytes of data) for this session. If the VMC device is in an invalid state, "
"EIO will be returned for the ioctl(). The device driver creates a new HMC "
"session value (ranging from 1 to 255) and HMC index value (starting at index "
"0 and ranging to 254) for this HMC ID. The driver then does an RDMA of the "
"HMC ID to the hypervisor, and then sends an Interface Open message to the "
"hypervisor to establish the session over the VMC. After the hypervisor "
"receives this information, it sends Add Buffer messages to the management "
"partition to seed an initial pool of buffers for the new HMC connection. "
"Finally, the hypervisor sends an Interface Open Response message, to "
"indicate that it is ready for normal runtime messaging. The following "
"illustrates this VMC flow:"

"During normal runtime, the management application and the hypervisor "
"exchange HMC messages via the Signal VMC message and RDMA operations. When "
"sending data to the hypervisor, the management application performs a "
"write() to the VMC device, and the driver RDMA’s the data to the hypervisor "
"and then sends a Signal Message. If a write() is attempted before VMC device "
"buffers have been made available by the hypervisor, or no buffers are "
"currently available, EBUSY is returned in response to the write(). A write() "
"will return EIO for all other errors, such as an invalid device state. When "
"the hypervisor sends a message to the management, the data is put into a VMC "
"buffer and an Signal Message is sent to the VMC driver in the management "
"partition. The driver RDMA’s the buffer into the partition and passes the "
"data up to the appropriate management application via a read() to the VMC "
"device. The read() request blocks if there is no buffer available to read. "
"The management application may use select() to wait for the VMC device to "
"become ready with data to read."
