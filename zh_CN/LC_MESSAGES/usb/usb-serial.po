"The driver was put together by looking at the usb bus transactions done by "
"Palm's driver under Windows, so a lot of functionality is still missing.  "
"Notably, serial ioctls are sometimes faked or not yet implemented.  Support "
"for finding out about DSR and CTS line status is however implemented (though "
"not nicely), so your favorite autopilot(1) and pilot-manager -daemon calls "
"will work.  Baud rates up to 115200 are supported, but handshaking (software "
"or hardware) is not, which is why it is wise to cut down on the rate used is "
"wise for large transfers until this is settled."
