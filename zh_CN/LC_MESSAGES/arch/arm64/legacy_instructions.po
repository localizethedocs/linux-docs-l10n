"The arm64 port of the Linux kernel provides infrastructure to support "
"emulation of instructions which have been deprecated, or obsoleted in the "
"architecture. The infrastructure code uses undefined instruction hooks to "
"support emulation. Where available it also allows turning on the instruction "
"execution in hardware."

"The emulation mode can be controlled by writing to sysctl nodes (/proc/sys/"
