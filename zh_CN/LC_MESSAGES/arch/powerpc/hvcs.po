"This is the device driver for the IBM Hypervisor Virtual Console Server, "

"space applications access to the system consoles of logically partitioned "
"operating systems (Linux and AIX) running on the same partitioned Power5 "
"ppc64 system.  Physical hardware consoles per partition are not practical on "

"Since this driver controls devices that provide a tty interface a user can "

"As a security feature to prevent the delivery of stale data to an unintended "

"When hvcs is being used to serve consoles this behavior is not a huge issue "
"because the adapter stays connected for large amounts of time following "
"almost all data writes.  When hvcs is being used as a tty conduit to tunnel "
"data between two partitions [see Q & A below] this is a huge problem because "
"the standard Linux behavior when cat'ing or dd'ing data to a device is to "
"open the tty, send the data, and then close the tty.  If this driver "

"vty-server and vty connection before the target vty has had a chance to "

#: ../../../arch/powerpc/hvcs.rst:421

"1. The creator of the /dev/hvcs* nodes has the ability to restrict the "

"3. Make sure to exit the user session when done with a console or the next "

"Q: How do I multiplex a console that I grab through hvcs so that other "

#: ../../../arch/powerpc/hvcs.rst:439
msgid ""
"A: You can use \"screen\" to directly connect to the /dev/hvcs* device and "
"setup a session on your machine with the console group privileges.  As "
"pointed out earlier by default screen doesn't provide the termcap settings "

"A: Please see the preceding section on \"Connection\" for a discussion of "

"Additionally, just because you logged into the console using and xterm "
"doesn't mean someone else didn't log into the console with the HMC console "
"(vt320) before you and leave the session logged in.  The best thing to do is "
"to export TERM to the terminal type of your terminal emulator when you get "
