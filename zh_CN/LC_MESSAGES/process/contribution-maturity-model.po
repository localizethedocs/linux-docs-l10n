"As a part of the 2021 Linux Kernel Maintainers’ Summit, there was a "
"`discussion <https://lwn.net/Articles/870581/>`_ about the challenges in "
"recruiting kernel maintainers as well as maintainer succession.  Some of the "
"conclusions from that discussion included that companies which are a part of "
"the Linux Kernel community need to allow engineers to be maintainers as part "
"of their job, so they can grow into becoming respected leaders and "
"eventually, kernel maintainers.  To support a strong talent pipeline, "
"developers should be allowed and encouraged to take on upstream "
"contributions such as reviewing other people’s patches, refactoring kernel "
"infrastructure, and writing documentation."

"To that end, the Linux Foundation Technical Advisory Board (TAB) proposes "
"this Linux Kernel Contribution Maturity Model. These common expectations for "
"upstream community engagement aim to increase the influence of individual "
"developers, increase the collaboration of organizations, and improve the "
"overall health of the Linux Kernel ecosystem."

"The TAB urges organizations to continuously evaluate their Open Source "
"maturity model and commit to improvements to align with this model.  To be "
"effective, this evaluation should incorporate feedback from across the "
"organization, including management and developers at all seniority levels.  "
"In the spirit of Open Source, we encourage organizations to publish their "
"evaluations and plans to improve their engagement with the upstream "
"community."
