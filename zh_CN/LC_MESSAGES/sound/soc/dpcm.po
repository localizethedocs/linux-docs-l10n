"Dynamic PCM allows an ALSA PCM device to digitally route its PCM audio to "
"various digital endpoints during the PCM stream runtime. e.g. PCM0 can route "
"digital audio to I2S DAI0, I2S DAI1 or PDM DAI2. This is useful for on SoC "
"DSP drivers that expose several ALSA PCMs and can route to multiple DAIs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/soc/dpcm.rst:13
msgid ""
"The DPCM runtime routing is determined by the ALSA mixer settings in the "
"same way as the analog signal is routed in an ASoC codec driver. DPCM uses a "
"DAPM graph representing the DSP internal audio paths and uses the mixer "
"settings to determine the path used by each ALSA PCM."

"Bluetooth, FM digital radio, Speakers, Headset Jack, digital microphones and "

"devices and supports 6 back end (BE) DAIs. Each FE PCM can digitally route "
"audio data to any of the BE DAIs. The FE PCM devices can also route audio to "
"more than 1 BE DAI."

"This FE DAI link is pretty similar to a regular DAI link except that we also "
