"The bareudp device supports special handling for MPLS & IP as they can have "
"multiple ethertypes. The MPLS protocol can have ethertypes ETH_P_MPLS_UC "
"(unicast) & ETH_P_MPLS_MC (multicast). IP protocol can have ethertypes "
"ETH_P_IP (v4) & ETH_P_IPV6 (v6). This special handling can be enabled only "
"for ethertypes ETH_P_IP & ETH_P_MPLS_UC with a flag called multiproto mode."
