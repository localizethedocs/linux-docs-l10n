"The Broadcom RoboSwitch Ethernet switch family is used in quite a range of "
"xDSL router, cable modems and other multimedia devices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dsa/b53.rst:10

"The actual implementation supports the devices BCM5325E, BCM5365, BCM539x, "
"BCM53115 and BCM53125 as well as BCM63XX."

"The driver is located in ``drivers/net/dsa/b53/`` and is implemented as a "
"DSA driver; see ``Documentation/networking/dsa/dsa.rst`` for details on the "
"subsystem and what it provides."

msgid ""
"The switch is, if possible, configured to enable a Broadcom specific 4-bytes "
"switch tag which gets inserted by the switch for every packet forwarded to "
"the CPU interface, conversely, the CPU network interface should insert a "
"similar tag for packets entering the CPU port. The tag format is described "
"in ``net/dsa/tag_brcm.c``."

"The tagging based configuration is desired. It is not specific to the b53 "
"DSA driver and will work like all DSA drivers which supports tagging."

msgid ""
"Older models (5325, 5365) support a different tag format that is not "
"supported yet. 539x and 531x5 require managed mode and some special "
"handling, which is also not yet supported. The tagging support is disabled "
"in these cases and the switch need a different configuration."

#: ../../../networking/dsa/b53.rst:50
msgid ""
"The b53 tags the CPU port in all VLANs, since otherwise any PVID untagged "
"VLAN programming would basically change the CPU port's default PVID and make "
"it untagged, undesirable."

msgid ""
"In difference to the configuration described in :ref:`dsa-vlan-"
"configuration` the default VLAN 1 has to be removed from the user interface "
