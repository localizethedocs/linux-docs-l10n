"This is a modem for 9600 baud FSK compatible to the G3RUH standard. The "

"interface to a KISS stream on a pseudo tty. There's also a patch available "

"The serial driver and the baycom serial drivers compete for the same "

"serial port. You might therefore find it necessary to release a port owned "
"by the serial driver with 'setserial /dev/ttyS# uart none', where # is the "
"number of the interface. The baycom drivers do not reserve any ports at "
"startup, unless one is specified on the 'insmod' command line. Another "
