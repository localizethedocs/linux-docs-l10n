"NI-700 and friends implement a distinct PMU for each clock domain within the "
"interconnect. Correspondingly, the driver exposes multiple PMU devices named "
"arm_ni_<x>_cd_<y>, where <x> is an (arbitrary) instance identifier and <y> "
"is the clock domain ID within that particular instance. If multiple NI "
"instances exist within a system, the PMU devices can be correlated with the "
"underlying hardware instance via sysfs parentage."

msgid ""
"Each PMU exposes base event aliases for the interface types present in its "
"clock domain. These require qualifying with the \"eventid\" and \"nodeid\" "
"parameters to specify the event code to count and the interface at which to "
"count it (per the configured hardware ID as reflected in the xxNI_NODE_INFO "
"register). The exception is the \"cycles\" alias for the PMU cycle counter, "
"which is encoded with the PMU node type and needs no further qualification."
