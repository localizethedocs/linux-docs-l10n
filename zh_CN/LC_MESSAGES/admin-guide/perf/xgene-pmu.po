"X-Gene SoC PMU consists of various independent system device PMUs such as L3 "
"cache(s), I/O bridge(s), memory controller bridge(s) and memory "
"controller(s). These PMU devices are loosely architected to follow the same "
"model as the PMU for ARM cores. The PMUs share the same top level interrupt "
"and status CSR region."

"The xgene-pmu driver registers several perf PMU drivers. Each of the perf "
"driver provides description of its available events and configuration "
"options in sysfs, see /sys/bus/event_source/devices/<l3cX/iobX/mcbX/mcX>/."

"The \"format\" directory describes format of the config (event ID), config1 "
"(agent ID) fields of the perf_event_attr structure. The \"events\" directory "
"provides configuration templates for all supported event types that can be "
"used with perf tool. For example, \"l3c0/bank-fifo-full/\" is an equivalent "
"of \"l3c0/config=0x0b/\"."

"Most of the SoC PMU has a specific list of agent ID used for monitoring "
"performance of a specific datapath. For example, agents of a L3 cache can be "
"a specific CPU or an I/O bridge. Each PMU has a set of 2 registers capable "
"of masking the agents from which the request come from. If the bit with the "
"bit number corresponding to the agent is set, the event is counted only if "
"it is caused by a request from that agent. Each agent ID bit is inversely "
"mapped to a corresponding bit in \"config1\" field. By default, the event "
"will be counted for all agent requests (config1 = 0x0). For all the "
"supported agents of each PMU, please refer to APM X-Gene User Manual."

"Each perf driver also provides a \"cpumask\" sysfs attribute, which contains "
