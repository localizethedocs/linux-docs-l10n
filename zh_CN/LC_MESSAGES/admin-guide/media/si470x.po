"Silicon Laboratories is the manufacturer of the radio ICs, that nowadays are "
"the most often used radio receivers in cell phones. Usually they are "
"connected with I2C. But SiLabs also provides a reference design, which "
"integrates this IC, together with a small microcontroller C8051F321, to form "
"a USB radio. Part of this reference design is also a radio application in "
"binary and source code. The software also contains an automatic firmware "
"upgrade to the most current version. Information on these can be downloaded "
