"Kcopyd provides the ability to copy a range of sectors from one block-device "
"to one or more other block-devices, with an asynchronous completion "
"notification. It is used by dm-snapshot and dm-mirror."

"Users of kcopyd must first create a client and indicate how many memory "
"pages to set aside for their copy jobs. This is done with a call to "
"kcopyd_client_create()::"

"To start a copy job, the user must set up io_region structures to describe "
"the source and destinations of the copy. Each io_region indicates a block-"
"device along with the starting sector and size of the region. The source of "
"the copy is given as one io_region structure, and the destinations of the "
"copy are given as an array of io_region structures::"
