"The device-mapper logging code is used by some of the device-mapper RAID "
"targets to track regions of the disk that are not consistent. A region (or "
"portion of the address space) of the disk may be inconsistent because a RAID "
"stripe is currently being operated on or a machine died while the region was "
"being altered.  In the case of mirrors, a region would be considered dirty/"
"inconsistent while you are writing to it because the writes need to be "
"replicated for all the legs of the mirror and may not reach the legs at the "
"same time. Once all writes are complete, the region is considered clean "
"again."

"There is a generic logging interface that the device-mapper RAID "
"implementations use to perform logging operations (see dm_dirty_log_type in "

"are available and provide different capabilities.  The list includes:"
