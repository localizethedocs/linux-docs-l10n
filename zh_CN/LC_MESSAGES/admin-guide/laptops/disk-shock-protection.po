"ATA/ATAPI-7 specifies the IDLE IMMEDIATE command with unload feature. "
"Issuing this command should cause the drive to switch to idle mode and "
"unload disk heads. This feature is being used in modern laptops in "
"conjunction with accelerometers and appropriate software to implement a "
"shock protection facility. The idea is to stop all I/O operations on the "
"internal hard drive and park its heads on the ramp when critical situations "
"are anticipated. The desire to have such a feature available on GNU/Linux "
"systems has been the original motivation to implement a generic disk head "
"parking interface in the Linux kernel. Please note, however, that other "
"components have to be set up on your system in order to get disk shock "
"protection working (see section 3. References below for pointers to more "
"information about that)."

"For each ATA device, the kernel exports the file `block/*/device/"
"unload_heads` in sysfs (here assumed to be mounted under /sys). Access to `/"
"sys/block/*/device/unload_heads` is denied with -EOPNOTSUPP if the device "
"does not support the unload feature. Otherwise, writing an integer value to "
"this file will take the heads of the respective drive off the platter and "
"block all I/O operations for the specified number of milliseconds. When the "
"timeout expires and no further disk head park request has been issued in the "
"meantime, normal operation will be resumed. The maximal value accepted for a "
"timeout is 30000 milliseconds. Exceeding this limit will return -EOVERFLOW, "
"but heads will be parked anyway and the timeout will be set to 30 seconds. "
"However, you can always change a timeout to any value between 0 and 30000 by "
"issuing a subsequent head park request before the timeout of the previous "
"one has expired. In particular, the total timeout can exceed 30 seconds and, "
"more importantly, you can cancel a previously set timeout and resume normal "
"operation immediately by specifying a timeout of 0. Values below -2 are "
"rejected with -EINVAL (see below for the special meaning of -1 and -2). If "
"the timeout specified for a recent head park request has not yet expired, "
"reading from `/sys/block/*/device/unload_heads` will report the number of "
"milliseconds remaining until normal operation will be resumed; otherwise, "
"reading the unload_heads attribute will return 0."

"A word of caution: The fact that the interface operates on a basis of "
"milliseconds may raise expectations that cannot be satisfied in reality. In "
"fact, the ATA specs clearly state that the time for an unload operation to "
"complete is vendor specific. The hint in ATA-7 that this will typically be "
"within 500 milliseconds apparently has been dropped in ATA-8."

"There is a technical detail of this implementation that may cause some "
"confusion and should be discussed here. When a head park request has been "
"issued to a device successfully, all I/O operations on the controller port "
"this device is attached to will be deferred. That is to say, any other "
"device that may be connected to the same port will be affected too. The only "
"exception is that a subsequent head unload request to that other device will "
"be executed immediately. Further operations on that port will be deferred "
"until the timeout specified for either device on the port has expired. As "
"far as PATA (old style IDE) configurations are concerned, there can only be "
"two devices attached to any single port. In SATA world we have port "
"multipliers which means that a user-issued head parking request to one "
"device may actually result in stopping I/O to a whole bunch of devices. "
"However, since this feature is supposed to be used on laptops and does not "
"seem to be very useful in any other environment, there will be mostly one "
"device per port. Even if the CD/DVD writer happens to be connected to the "
"same port as the hard drive, it generally *should* recover just fine from "
"the occasional buffer under-run incurred by a head park request to the HD. "
"Actually, when you are using an ide driver rather than its libata "
"counterpart (i.e. your disk is called /dev/hda instead of /dev/sda), then "
"parking the heads of one drive (drive X) will generally not affect the mode "
"of operation of another drive (drive Y) on the same port as described above. "
"It is only when a port reset is required to recover from an exception on "
"drive Y that further I/O operations on that drive (and the reset itself) "
"will be delayed until drive X is no longer in the parked state."

"Finally, there are some hard drives that only comply with an earlier version "
"of the ATA standard than ATA-7, but do support the unload feature "
"nonetheless. Unfortunately, there is no safe way Linux can detect these "
"devices, so you won't be able to write to the unload_heads attribute. If you "
"know that your device really does support the unload feature (for instance, "
"because the vendor of your laptop or the hard drive itself told you so), "
"then you can tell the kernel to enable the usage of this feature for that "
"drive by writing the special value -1 to the unload_heads attribute::"

"There are several laptops from different vendors featuring shock protection "
"capabilities. As manufacturers have refused to support open source "
"development of the required software components so far, Linux support for "
"shock protection varies considerably between different hardware "
"implementations. Ideally, this section should contain a list of pointers at "
"different projects aiming at an implementation of shock protection on "
"different systems. Unfortunately, I only know of a single project which, "
"although still considered experimental, is fit for use. Please feel free to "
"add projects that have been the victims of my ignorance."
