"The GPIO Testing Driver (gpio-mockup) provides a way to create simulated "
"GPIO chips for testing purposes. The lines exposed by these chips can be "
"accessed using the standard GPIO character device interface as well as "
"manipulated using the dedicated debugfs directory structure."

"This parameter takes an argument in the form of an array of integer pairs. "
"Each pair defines the base GPIO number (non-negative integer) and the first "
"number after the last of this chip. If the base GPIO is -1, the gpiolib will "
"assign it automatically. while the following parameter is the number of "
"lines exposed by the chip."
