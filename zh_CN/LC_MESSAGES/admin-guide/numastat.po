"The numa_hit, numa_miss and numa_foreign counters reflect how well processes "
"are able to allocate memory from nodes they prefer. If they succeed, "

"Usually preferred node is the one local to the CPU where the process "
"executes, but restrictions such as mempolicies can change that, so there are "
"also two counters based on CPU local node. local_node is similar to numa_hit "
"and is incremented on allocation from a node by CPU on the same node. "
"other_node is similar to numa_miss and is incremented on the node where "
"allocation succeeds from a CPU from a different node. Note there is no "
"counter analogical to numa_foreign."

"Note that on systems with memoryless nodes (where a node has CPUs but no "
"memory) the numa_hit, numa_miss and numa_foreign statistics can be skewed "
"heavily. In the current kernel implementation, if a process prefers a "
"memoryless node (i.e.  because it is running on one of its local CPU), the "
"implementation actually treats one of the nearest nodes with memory as the "
"preferred node. As a result, such allocation will not increase the "
"numa_foreign counter on the memoryless node, and will skew the numa_hit, "
"numa_miss and numa_foreign statistics of the nearest node."
