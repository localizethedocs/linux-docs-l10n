"Data Access Monitoring Results Stat (DAMON_STAT) is a static kernel module "
"that is aimed to be used for simple access pattern monitoring.  It monitors "
"accesses on the system's entire physical memory using DAMON, and provides "
"simplified access monitoring results statistics, namely idle time "
"percentiles and estimated memory bandwidth."

"DAMON_STAT uses monitoring intervals :ref:`auto-tuning "
"<damon_design_monitoring_intervals_autotuning>` to make its accuracy high "
"and overhead minimum.  It auto-tunes the intervals aiming 4 % of observable "
"access events to be captured in each snapshot, while limiting the resulting "
"sampling interval to be 5 milliseconds in minimum and 10 seconds in "
"maximum.  On a few production server systems, it resulted in consuming only "
"0.x % single CPU time, while capturing reasonable quality of access "
"patterns.  The tuning-resulting intervals can be retrieved via "
"``aggr_interval_us`` :ref:`parameter <damon_stat_aggr_interval_us>`."

"To use this feature, you should first ensure your system is running on a "

"enabled by default at build time, by setting "

"DAMON_STAT calculates how long each byte of the memory was not accessed "

"regions having access frequency (nr_accesses) larger than zero, how long the "
"current access frequency level was kept multiplied by ``-1`` becomes the "
"idlee time of every byte of the region.  If a region has zero access "
"frequency (nr_accesses), how long the region was keeping the zero access "
"frequency (age) becomes the idle time of every byte of the region.  Then, "
"DAMON_STAT exposes the percentiles of the idle time values via this read-"
"only parameter.  Reading the parameter returns 101 idle time values in "
"milliseconds, separated by comma. Each value represents 0-th, 1st, 2nd, "
"3rd, ..., 99th and 100th percentile idle times."
