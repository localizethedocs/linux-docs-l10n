"In bcachefs, as a hard rule we do not throw or directly use standard error "
"codes (-EINVAL, -EBUSY, etc.). Instead, we define private error codes as "
"needed in fs/bcachefs/errcode.h."

"This gives us much better error messages and makes debugging much easier. "
"Any direct uses of standard error codes you see in the source code are "
"simply old code that has yet to be converted - feel free to clean it up!"

"Private error codes may subtype another error code, this allows for grouping "
"of related errors that should be handled similarly (e.g. transaction restart "
"errors), as well as specifying which standard error code should be returned "
"at the bcachefs module boundary."

#: ../../../filesystems/bcachefs/errorcodes.rst:19
msgid ""
"At the module boundary, we use bch2_err_class() to convert to a standard "
"error code; this also emits a trace event so that the original error code be "
"recovered even if it wasn't logged."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/bcachefs/errorcodes.rst:23
msgid ""
"Do not reuse error codes! Generally speaking, a private error code should "
"only be thrown in one place. That means that when we see it in a log message "
"we can see, unambiguously, exactly which file and line number it was "
"returned from."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/bcachefs/errorcodes.rst:27
msgid ""
"Try to give error codes names that are as reasonably descriptive of the "
"error as possible. Frequently, the error will be logged at a place far "
"removed from where the error was generated; good names for error codes mean "
"much more descriptive and useful error messages."
