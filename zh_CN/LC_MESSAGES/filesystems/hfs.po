"HFS stands for ``Hierarchical File System`` and is the filesystem used by "
"the Mac Plus and all later Macintosh models.  Earlier Macintosh models used "
"MFS (``Macintosh File System``), which is not supported, MacOS 8.1 and newer "
"support a filesystem called HFS+ that's similar to HFS but is extended in "
"various areas.  Use the hfsplus filesystem driver to access such filesystems "
