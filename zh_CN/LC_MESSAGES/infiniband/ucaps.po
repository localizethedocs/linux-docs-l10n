"User CAPabilities (UCAPs) provide fine-grained control over specific "
"firmware features in Infiniband (IB) devices. This approach offers more "
"granular capabilities than the existing Linux capabilities, which may be too "
"generic for certain FW features."

"Each user capability is represented as a character device with root read-"

"To create a new UCAP, drivers must first define a type in the rdma_user_cap "

"API with the UCAP type."
