"A Devicetree changeset is a method which allows one to apply changes in the "
"live tree in such a way that either the full set of changes will be applied, "
"or none of them will be. If an error occurs partway through applying the "
"changeset, then the tree will be rolled back to the previous state. A "
"changeset can also be removed after it has been applied."

"When a changeset is applied, all of the changes get applied to the tree at "
"once before emitting OF_RECONFIG notifiers. This is so that the receiver "
"sees a complete and consistent state of the tree when it receives the "
"notifier."

"of_changeset_apply() - Apply the changes to the tree. Either the entire "
