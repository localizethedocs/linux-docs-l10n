"Metronomefb is a driver for the Metronome display controller. The controller "
"is from E-Ink Corporation. It is intended to be used to drive the E-Ink "
"Vizplex display media. E-Ink hosts some details of this controller and the "
"display media here http://www.e-ink.com/products/matrix/metronome.html ."

"Metronome is interfaced to the host CPU through the AMLCD interface. The "
"host CPU generates the control information and the image in a framebuffer "
"which is then delivered to the AMLCD interface by a host specific method. "
"The display and error status are each pulled through individual GPIOs."

"Metronomefb is platform independent and depends on a board specific driver "
"to do all physical IO work. Currently, an example is implemented for the PXA "
"board used in the AM-200 EPD devkit. This example is am200epd.c"

"Metronomefb requires waveform information which is delivered via the AMLCD "
"interface to the metronome controller. The waveform information is expected "
"to be delivered from userspace via the firmware class interface. The "
"waveform file can be compressed as long as your udev or hotplug script is "
"aware of the need to uncompress it before delivering it. metronomefb will "
"ask for metronome.wbf which would typically go into /lib/firmware/metronome."
"wbf depending on your udev/hotplug setup. I have only tested with a single "
"waveform file which was originally labeled 23P01201_60_WT0107_MTC. I do not "
"know what it stands for. Caution should be exercised when manipulating the "
"waveform as there may be a possibility that it could have some permanent "
"effects on the display media. I neither have access to nor know exactly what "
"the waveform does in terms of the physical media."

"Metronomefb uses the deferred IO interface so that it can provide a memory "
"mappable frame buffer. It has been tested with tinyx (Xfbdev). It is known "
"to work at this time with xeyes, xclock, xloadimage, xpdf."
