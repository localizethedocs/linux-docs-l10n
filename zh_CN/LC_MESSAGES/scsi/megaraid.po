"Different classes of controllers from LSI Logic accept and respond to the "
"user applications in a similar way. They understand the same firmware "
"control commands. Furthermore, the applications also can treat different "
"classes of the controllers uniformly. Hence it is logical to have a single "
"module that interfaces with the applications on one side and all the low "
"level drivers on the other."

"Currently this module (called Common Management Module) is used only to "
"issue ioctl commands. But this module is envisioned to handle all user space "
"level interactions. So any 'proc', 'sysfs' implementations will be localized "
"in this common module."

"The Common Management Module is implemented in megaraid_mm.[ch] files. This "
"module acts as a registry for low level hba drivers. The low level drivers "

"The lower level drivers now understand only a new improved ioctl packet "
"called uioc_t. The management module converts the older ioctl packets from "
"the older applications into uioc_t. After driver handles the uioc_t, the "
"common module will convert that back into the old format before returning to "
"applications."

"As new applications evolve and replace the old ones, the old packet format "
"will be retired."

msgid ""
"Common module dedicates one uioc_t packet to each controller registered. "
"This can easily be more than one. But since megaraid is the only low level "
"driver today, and it can handle only one ioctl, there is no reason to have "
"more. But as new controller classes get added, this will be tuned "
"appropriately."
