"_DSD (Device Specific Data) [dsd-guide] is a predefined ACPI device "
"configuration object that can be used to convey information on hardware "
"features which are not specifically covered by the ACPI specification "
"[acpi]. There are two _DSD extensions that are relevant for graphs: property "
"[dsd-guide] and hierarchical data extensions. The property extension "
"provides generic key-value pairs whereas the hierarchical data extension "
"supports nodes with references to other nodes, forming a tree. The nodes in "
"the tree may contain properties as defined by the property extension. The "
"two extensions together provide a tree-like structure with zero or more "
"properties (key-value pairs) in each node of the tree."
