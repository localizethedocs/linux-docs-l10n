"Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) is a PCI Express Extended capability "
"which makes one physical device appear as multiple virtual devices. The "
"physical device is referred to as Physical Function (PF) while the virtual "
"devices are referred to as Virtual Functions (VF). Allocation of the VF can "
"be dynamically controlled by the PF via registers encapsulated in the "
"capability. By default, this feature is not enabled and the PF behaves as "
"traditional PCIe device. Once it's turned on, each VF's PCI configuration "
"space can be accessed by its own Bus, Device and Function Number (Routing "
"ID). And each VF also has PCI Memory Space, which is used to map its "
"register set. VF device driver operates on the register set so it can be "
"functional and appear as a real existing PCI device."

"Multiple methods are available for SR-IOV enablement. In the first method, "
"the device driver (PF driver) will control the enabling and disabling of the "
"capability via API provided by SR-IOV core. If the hardware has SR-IOV "
"capability, loading its PF driver would enable it and all VFs associated "
"with the PF.  Some PF drivers require a module parameter to be set to "
"determine the number of VFs to enable. In the second method, a write to the "
"sysfs file sriov_numvfs will enable and disable the VFs associated with a "
"PCIe PF.  This method enables per-PF, VF enable/disable values versus the "
"first method, which applies to all PFs of the same device.  Additionally, "
"the PCI SRIOV core support ensures that enable/disable operations are valid "
"to reduce duplication in multiple drivers for the same checks, e.g., check "
"numvfs == 0 if enabling VFs, ensure numvfs <= totalvfs. The second method is "
"the recommended method for new/future VF devices."

"The VF is treated as hot-plugged PCI devices in the kernel, so they should "
"be able to work in the same way as real PCI devices. The VF requires device "
"driver that is same as a normal PCI device's."
