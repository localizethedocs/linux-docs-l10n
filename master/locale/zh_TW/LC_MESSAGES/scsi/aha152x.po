"SCSI uses block numbers to address blocks/sectors on a device. The BIOS uses "
"a cylinder/head/sector addressing scheme (C/H/S) scheme instead.  DOS "
"expects a BIOS or driver that understands this C/H/S addressing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/aha152x.rst:130
msgid ""
"The number of cylinders/heads/sectors is called geometry and is required as "
"base for requests in C/H/S addressing.  SCSI only knows about the total "
"capacity of disks in blocks (sectors)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/aha152x.rst:134
msgid ""
"Therefore the SCSI BIOS/DOS driver has to calculate a logical/virtual "
"geometry just to be able to support that addressing scheme.  The geometry "
"returned by the SCSI BIOS is a pure calculation and has nothing to do with "
"the real/physical geometry of the disk (which is usually irrelevant anyway)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/aha152x.rst:140
msgid ""
"Basically this has no impact at all on Linux, because it also uses block "
"instead of C/H/S addressing.  Unfortunately C/H/S addressing is also used in "
"the partition table and therefore every operating system has to know the "
"right geometry to be able to interpret it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/aha152x.rst:145
msgid ""
"Moreover there are certain limitations to the C/H/S addressing scheme, "
"namely the address space is limited to up to 255 heads, up to 63 sectors and "
"a maximum of 1023 cylinders."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/aha152x.rst:149
msgid ""
"The AHA-1522 BIOS calculates the geometry by fixing the number of heads to "
"64, the number of sectors to 32 and by calculating the number of cylinders "
"by dividing the capacity reported by the disk by 64*32 (1 MB). This is "
"considered to be the default translation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/aha152x.rst:154
msgid ""
"With respect to the limit of 1023 cylinders using C/H/S you can only address "
"the first GB of your disk in the partition table.  Therefore BIOSes of some "
"newer controllers based on the AIC-6260/6360 support extended translation.  "
"This means that the BIOS uses 255 for heads, 63 for sectors and then divides "
"the capacity of the disk by 255*63 (about 8 MB), as soon it sees a disk "
"greater than 1 GB.  That results in a maximum of about 8 GB addressable "
"diskspace in the partition table (but there are already bigger disks out "
"there today)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/aha152x.rst:163

"configurable in certain BIOS setups."
