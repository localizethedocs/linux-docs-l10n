"Broadcom FCoE offload through bnx2fc is full stateful hardware offload that "
"cooperates with all interfaces provided by the Linux ecosystem for FC/FCoE "
"and SCSI controllers.  As such, FCoE functionality, once enabled is largely "
"transparent. Devices discovered on the SAN will be registered and "
"unregistered automatically with the upper storage layers."

"Despite the fact that the Broadcom's FCoE offload is fully offloaded, it "
"does depend on the state of the network interfaces to operate. As such, the "
"network interface (e.g. eth0) associated with the FCoE offload initiator "
"must be 'up'. It is recommended that the network interfaces be configured to "
"be brought up automatically at boot time."

"Furthermore, the Broadcom FCoE offload solution creates VLAN interfaces to "
"support the VLANs that have been discovered for FCoE operation (e.g. "
"eth0.1001-fcoe).  Do not delete or disable these interfaces or FCoE "
"operation will be disrupted."
