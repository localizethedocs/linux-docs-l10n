"It is important to understand if the problem you want to debug manifests "
"itself consistently (i.e. given a set of inputs you always get the same, "
"incorrect output), or inconsistently. If it manifests itself inconsistently, "
"some timing factor might be at play. If inserting delays into the code does "
"change the behavior, then quite likely timing is a factor."

"When timing does alter the outcome of the code execution using a simple "
"printk() for debugging purposes may not work, a similar alternative is to "
"use trace_printk() , which logs the debug messages to the trace file instead "
"of the kernel log."
