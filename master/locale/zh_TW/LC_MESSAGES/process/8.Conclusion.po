"There are numerous sources of information on Linux kernel development and "
"related topics.  First among those will always be the Documentation "
"directory found in the kernel source distribution.  Start with the top-"
"level :ref:`process/howto.rst <process_howto>`; also read :ref:`process/"
"submitting-patches.rst <submittingpatches>`. Many internal kernel APIs are "
"documented using the kerneldoc mechanism; \"make htmldocs\" or \"make "
"pdfdocs\" can be used to generate those documents in HTML or PDF format "
"(though the version of TeX shipped by some distributions runs into internal "
"limits and fails to process the documents properly)."

"In the end, it's the participation that matters.  Any open source software "
"project is no more than the sum of what its contributors put into it.  The "
"Linux kernel has progressed as quickly and as well as it has because it has "
"been helped by an impressively large group of developers, all of whom are "
"working to make it better.  The kernel is a premier example of what can be "
"done when thousands of people work together toward a common goal."

"The kernel can always benefit from a larger developer base, though.  There "
"is always more work to do.  But, just as importantly, most other "
"participants in the Linux ecosystem can benefit through contributing to the "
"kernel.  Getting code into the mainline is the key to higher code quality, "
"lower maintenance and distribution costs, a higher level of influence over "
"the direction of kernel development, and more.  It is a situation where "
"everybody involved wins.  Fire up your editor and come join us; you will be "
"more than welcome."
