"As developers of the Linux kernel, we have a keen interest in how our "
"software is used and how the license for our software is enforced.  "
"Compliance with the reciprocal sharing obligations of GPL-2.0 is critical to "
"the long-term sustainability of our software and community."

"Although there is a right to enforce the separate copyright interests in the "
"contributions made to our community, we share an interest in ensuring that "
"individual enforcement actions are conducted in a manner that benefits our "
"community and do not have an unintended negative impact on the health and "
"growth of our software ecosystem.  In order to deter unhelpful enforcement "
"actions, we agree that it is in the best interests of our development "
"community to undertake the following commitment to users of the Linux kernel "
"on behalf of ourselves and any successors to our copyright interests:"

"However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from "

"Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated "

"Our intent in providing these assurances is to encourage more use of the "

"this software.  We want to work with users in an open and transparent way to "

"enforcement that might limit adoption of our software.  We view legal action "
"as a last resort, to be initiated only when other community efforts have "
"failed to resolve the problem."
