"Version 17 of schedstats removed 'lb_imbalance' field as it has no "
"significance anymore and instead added more relevant fields namely "
"'lb_imbalance_load', 'lb_imbalance_util', 'lb_imbalance_task' and "
"'lb_imbalance_misfit'. The domain field prints the name of the corresponding "
"sched domain from this version onwards."

"Version 16 of schedstats changed the order of definitions within 'enum "
"cpu_idle_type', which changed the order of [CPU_MAX_IDLE_TYPES] columns in "

"changed places. The size of the array is unchanged."

"Version 14 of schedstats includes support for sched_domains, which hit the "
"mainline kernel in 2.6.20 although it is identical to the stats from version "
"12 which was in the kernel from 2.6.13-2.6.19 (version 13 never saw a kernel "
"release).  Some counters make more sense to be per-runqueue; other to be per-"
"domain.  Note that domains (and their associated information) will only be "

"In version 14 of schedstat, there is at least one level of domain statistics "
"for each cpu listed, and there may well be more than one domain.  Domains "
"have no particular names in this implementation, but the highest numbered "
"one typically arbitrates balancing across all the cpus on the machine, while "
"domain0 is the most tightly focused domain, sometimes balancing only between "
"pairs of cpus.  At this time, there are no architectures which need more "
"than three domain levels. The first field in the domain stats is a bit map "
"indicating which cpus are affected by that domain. Details are available at"
