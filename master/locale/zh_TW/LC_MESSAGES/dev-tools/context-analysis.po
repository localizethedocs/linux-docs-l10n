"Context Analysis is a language extension, which enables statically checking "
"that required contexts are active (or inactive) by acquiring and releasing "
"user-definable \"context locks\". An obvious application is lock-safety "
"checking for the kernel's various synchronization primitives (each of which "
"represents a \"context lock\"), and checking that locking rules are not "
"violated."

"Context analysis is a way to specify permissibility of operations to depend "
"on context locks being held (or not held). Typically we are interested in "
"protecting data and code in a critical section by requiring a specific "
"context to be active, for example by holding a specific lock. The analysis "
"ensures that callers cannot perform an operation without the required "
"context being active."

"Context locks are associated with named structs, along with functions that "
"operate on struct instances to acquire and release the associated context "

"Context locks can be held either exclusively or shared. This mechanism "
"allows assigning more precise privileges when a context is active, typically "
"to distinguish where a thread may only read (shared) or also write "
"(exclusive) to data guarded within a context."

msgid ""
"The set of contexts that are actually active in a given thread at a given "
"point in program execution is a run-time concept. The static analysis works "
"by calculating an approximation of that set, called the context environment. "
"The context environment is calculated for every program point, and describes "
"the set of contexts that are statically known to be active, or inactive, at "
"that particular point. This environment is a conservative approximation of "
"the full set of contexts that will actually be active in a thread at run-"
"time."

"Clang originally called the feature `Thread Safety Analysis <https://clang."
"llvm.org/docs/ThreadSafetyAnalysis.html>`_, with some keywords and "
"documentation still using the thread-safety-analysis-only terminology. This "
"was later changed and the feature became more flexible, gaining the ability "
"to define custom \"capabilities\". Its foundations can be found in "
"`Capability Systems <https://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc/papers/capabilities."
"pdf>`_, used to specify the permissibility of operations to depend on some "
"\"capability\" being held (or not held)."

"Because the feature is not just able to express capabilities related to "
"synchronization primitives, and \"capability\" is already overloaded in the "
"kernel, the naming chosen for the kernel departs from Clang's initial "
"\"Thread Safety\" and \"capability\" nomenclature; we refer to the feature "
"as \"Context Analysis\" to avoid confusion. The internal implementation "
"still makes references to Clang's terminology in a few places, such as `-"
"Wthread-safety` being the warning option that also still appears in "
"diagnostic messages."
