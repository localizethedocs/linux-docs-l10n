"When writing unit tests, it's important to be able to isolate the code being "
"tested from other parts of the kernel. This ensures the reliability of the "
"test (it won't be affected by external factors), reduces dependencies on "
"specific hardware or config options (making the test easier to run), and "
"protects the stability of the rest of the system (making it less likely for "
"test-specific state to interfere with the rest of the system)."

"While for some code (typically generic data structures, helpers, and other "
"\"pure functions\") this is trivial, for others (like device drivers, "
"filesystems, core subsystems) the code is heavily coupled with other parts "
"of the kernel."

msgid ""
"This coupling is often due to global state in some way: be it a global list "
"of devices, the filesystem, or some hardware state. Tests need to either "
"carefully manage, isolate, and restore state, or they can avoid it "
"altogether by replacing access to and mutation of this state with a \"fake\" "
"or \"mock\" variant."

"By refactoring access to such state, such as by introducing a layer of "
"indirection which can use or emulate a separate set of test state. However, "
"such refactoring comes with its own costs (and undertaking significant "
"refactoring before being able to write tests is suboptimal)."
