"ALSA uses kcontrols to export audio controls(switch, volume, Mux, ...) to "
"user space. This means userspace applications like pulseaudio can switch off "
"headphones and switch on speakers when no headphones are plugged in."

"The old ALSA jack code only created input devices for each registered jack. "
