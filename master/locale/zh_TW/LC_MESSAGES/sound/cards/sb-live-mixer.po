"This PCM device (it's the 3rd PCM device (index 2!) and first subdevice "
"(index 0) for a given card) allows to forward 48kHz, stereo, 16-bit little "

"optical). The universal interface allows the creation of up to 8 raw PCM "
"devices operating at 48kHz, 16-bit little endian. It would be easy to add "
"support for multichannel devices to the current code, but the conversion "
"routines exist only for stereo (2-channel streams) at the time."
