"The Power Sourcing Equipment Power Interface (PSE PI) plays a pivotal role "
"in the architecture of Power over Ethernet (PoE) systems. It is essentially "
"a blueprint that outlines how one or multiple power sources are connected to "
"the eight-pin modular jack, commonly known as the Ethernet RJ45 port. This "

"Single Pair Ethernet (SPE) represents a different approach to Ethernet "

"transmission. Unlike the configurations detailed in the PSE PI for standard "
"Ethernet, which can involve multiple power sourcing arrangements across four "
