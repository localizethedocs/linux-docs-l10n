msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/device_drivers/atm/fore200e.rst:7
msgid ""
"This driver adds support for the FORE Systems 200E-series ATM adapters to "
"the Linux operating system. It is based on the earlier PCA-200E driver "
"written by Uwe Dannowski."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/device_drivers/atm/fore200e.rst:11
msgid ""
"The driver simultaneously supports PCA-200E and SBA-200E adapters on i386, "
"alpha (untested), powerpc, sparc and sparc64 archs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/device_drivers/atm/fore200e.rst:14
msgid ""
"The intent is to enable the use of different models of FORE adapters at the "
"same time, by hosts that have several bus interfaces (such as PCI+SBUS, or "
"PCI+EISA)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/device_drivers/atm/fore200e.rst:18
msgid ""
"Only PCI and SBUS devices are currently supported by the driver, but support "
"for other bus interfaces such as EISA should not be too hard to add."

"The FORE Systems 200E-series driver is shipped with firmware data being "
"uploaded to the ATM adapters at system boot time or at module loading time. "
"The supplied firmware images should work with all adapters."

msgid ""
"However, if you encounter problems (the firmware doesn't start or the driver "
"is unable to read the PROM data), you may consider trying another firmware "
"version. Alternative binary firmware images can be found somewhere on the "
"ForeThought CD-ROM supplied with your adapter by FORE Systems."

"Notice that different versions of the PCA-200E firmware exist, depending on "

"little and big endian PCA firmware images."
