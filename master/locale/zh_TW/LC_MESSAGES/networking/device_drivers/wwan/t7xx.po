msgid ""
"The t7xx driver is a WWAN PCIe host driver developed for linux or Chrome OS "
"platforms for data exchange over PCIe interface between Host platform & "
"MediaTek's T700 5G modem. The driver exposes an interface conforming to the "
"MBIM protocol [1]. Any front end application (e.g. Modem Manager) could "
"easily manage the MBIM interface to enable data communication towards WWAN. "
"The driver also provides an interface to interact with the MediaTek's modem "
"via AT commands."
