"``devlink`` provides the ability for drivers to register resources, which "
"can allow administrators to see the device restrictions for a given "
"resource, as well as how much of the given resource is currently in use. "
"Additionally, these resources can optionally have configurable size. This "
"could enable the administrator to limit the number of resources that are "
"used."

"For example, the ``netdevsim`` driver enables ``/IPv4/fib`` and ``/IPv4/fib-"
"rules`` as resources to limit the number of IPv4 FIB entries and rules for a "
"given device."

"Each resource is represented by an id, and contains information about its "
"current size and related sub resources. To access a sub resource, you "
"specify the path of the resource. For example ``/IPv4/fib`` is the id for "
"the ``fib`` sub-resource under the ``IPv4`` resource."
