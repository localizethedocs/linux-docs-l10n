"Several types are supported for fetch-args. Uprobe tracer will access memory "
"by given type. Prefix 's' and 'u' means those types are signed and unsigned "
"respectively. 'x' prefix implies it is unsigned. Traced arguments are shown "
"in decimal ('s' and 'u') or hexadecimal ('x'). Without type casting, 'x32' "
"or 'x64' is used depends on the architecture (e.g. x86-32 uses x32, and "
"x86-64 uses x64). String type is a special type, which fetches a \"null-"
"terminated\" string from user space. Bitfield is another special type, which "
"takes 3 parameters, bit-width, bit- offset, and container-size (usually 32). "
"The syntax is::"
