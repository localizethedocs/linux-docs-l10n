msgid ""
"It uses the zlib routines to compress a file one page at a time, and allows "
"random page access.  The meta-data is not compressed, but is expressed in a "
"very terse representation to make it use much less diskspace than "
"traditional filesystems."

"You can't write to a cramfs filesystem (making it compressible and compact "
"also makes it _very_ hard to update on-the-fly), so you have to create the "
"disk image with the \"mkcramfs\" utility."

"Only the low 8 bits of gid are stored.  The current version of mkcramfs "
"simply truncates to 8 bits, which is a potential security issue."

"Cramfs directories have no ``.`` or ``..`` entries.  Directories (like every "
"other file on cramfs) always have a link count of 1.  (There's no need to "
"use -noleaf in ``find``, btw.)"

"No timestamps are stored in a cramfs, so these default to the epoch (1970 "
"GMT).  Recently-accessed files may have updated timestamps, but the update "
"lasts only as long as the inode is cached in memory, after which the "
"timestamp reverts to 1970, i.e. moves backwards in time."

#: ../../../filesystems/cramfs.rst:43
msgid ""
"Currently, cramfs must be written and read with architectures of the same "
"endianness, and can be read only by kernels with PAGE_SIZE == 4096.  At "
"least the latter of these is a bug, but it hasn't been decided what the best "
"fix is.  For the moment if you have larger pages you can just change the "
"#define in mkcramfs.c, so long as you don't mind the filesystem becoming "
"unreadable to future kernels."

msgid "Memory Mapped cramfs image"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/cramfs.rst:54
msgid ""
"The CRAMFS_MTD Kconfig option adds support for loading data directly from a "
"physical linear memory range (usually non volatile memory like Flash) "
"instead of going through the block device layer. This saves some memory "
"since no intermediate buffering is necessary to hold the data before "
"decompressing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/cramfs.rst:60
msgid ""
"And when data blocks are kept uncompressed and properly aligned, they will "
"automatically be mapped directly into user space whenever possible providing "
"eXecute-In-Place (XIP) from ROM of read-only segments. Data segments mapped "
"read-write (hence they have to be copied to RAM) may still be compressed in "
"the cramfs image in the same file along with non compressed read-only "
"segments. Both MMU and no-MMU systems are supported. This is particularly "
"handy for tiny embedded systems with very tight memory constraints."

msgid ""
"The location of the cramfs image in memory is system dependent. You must "
"know the proper physical address where the cramfs image is located and "
"configure an MTD device for it. Also, that MTD device must be supported by a "
"map driver that implements the \"point\" method. Examples of such MTD "
"drivers are cfi_cmdset_0001 (Intel/Sharp CFI flash) or physmap (Flash device "
"in physical memory map). MTD partitions based on such devices are fine too. "
"Then that device should be specified with the \"mtd:\" prefix as the mount "
"device argument. For example, to mount the MTD device named \"fs_partition\" "
"on the /mnt directory::"
