"The largest scalability problem facing XFS is not one of algorithmic "
"scalability, but of verification of the filesystem structure. Scalabilty of "
"the structures and indexes on disk and the algorithms for iterating them are "
"adequate for supporting PB scale filesystems with billions of inodes, "
"however it is this very scalability that causes the verification problem."

"Almost all metadata on XFS is dynamically allocated. The only fixed location "
"metadata is the allocation group headers (SB, AGF, AGFL and AGI), while all "
"other metadata structures need to be discovered by walking the filesystem "
"structure in different ways. While this is already done by userspace tools "
"for validating and repairing the structure, there are limits to what they "
"can verify, and this in turn limits the supportable size of an XFS "
"filesystem."

"For example, it is entirely possible to manually use xfs_db and a bit of "
"scripting to analyse the structure of a 100TB filesystem when trying to "
"determine the root cause of a corruption problem, but it is still mainly a "
"manual task of verifying that things like single bit errors or misplaced "
"writes weren't the ultimate cause of a corruption event. It may take a few "
"hours to a few days to perform such forensic analysis, so for at this scale "
"root cause analysis is entirely possible."

"However, if we scale the filesystem up to 1PB, we now have 10x as much "
"metadata to analyse and so that analysis blows out towards weeks/months of "
"forensic work. Most of the analysis work is slow and tedious, so as the "
"amount of analysis goes up, the more likely that the cause will be lost in "
"the noise.  Hence the primary concern for supporting PB scale filesystems is "
"minimising the time and effort required for basic forensic analysis of the "
"filesystem structure."

"One of the problems with the current metadata format is that apart from the "
"magic number in the metadata block, we have no other way of identifying what "
"it is supposed to be. We can't even identify if it is the right place. Put "
"simply, you can't look at a single metadata block in isolation and say "
"\"yes, it is supposed to be there and the contents are valid\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/xfs/xfs-self-describing-metadata.rst:49
msgid ""
"Hence most of the time spent on forensic analysis is spent doing basic "
"verification of metadata values, looking for values that are in range (and "
"hence not detected by automated verification checks) but are not correct. "
"Finding and understanding how things like cross linked block lists (e.g. "
"sibling pointers in a btree end up with loops in them) are the key to "
"understanding what went wrong, but it is impossible to tell what order the "
"blocks were linked into each other or written to disk after the fact."

"Hence we need to record more information into the metadata to allow us to "
"quickly determine if the metadata is intact and can be ignored for the "
"purpose of analysis. We can't protect against every possible type of error, "
"but we can ensure that common types of errors are easily detectable.  Hence "
"the concept of self describing metadata."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/xfs/xfs-self-describing-metadata.rst:63
msgid ""
"The first, fundamental requirement of self describing metadata is that the "
"metadata object contains some form of unique identifier in a well known "
"location. This allows us to identify the expected contents of the block and "
"hence parse and verify the metadata object. IF we can't independently "
"identify the type of metadata in the object, then the metadata doesn't "
"describe itself very well at all!"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Luckily, almost all XFS metadata has magic numbers embedded already - only "
"the AGFL, remote symlinks and remote attribute blocks do not contain "
"identifying magic numbers. Hence we can change the on-disk format of all "
"these objects to add more identifying information and detect this simply by "
"changing the magic numbers in the metadata objects. That is, if it has the "
"current magic number, the metadata isn't self identifying. If it contains a "
"new magic number, it is self identifying and we can do much more expansive "
"automated verification of the metadata object at runtime, during forensic "
"analysis or repair."

msgid ""
"As a primary concern, self describing metadata needs some form of overall "
"integrity checking. We cannot trust the metadata if we cannot verify that it "
"has not been changed as a result of external influences. Hence we need some "
"form of integrity check, and this is done by adding CRC32c validation to the "
"metadata block. If we can verify the block contains the metadata it was "
"intended to contain, a large amount of the manual verification work can be "
"skipped."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/xfs/xfs-self-describing-metadata.rst:86
msgid ""
"CRC32c was selected as metadata cannot be more than 64k in length in XFS and "
"hence a 32 bit CRC is more than sufficient to detect multi-bit errors in "
"metadata blocks. CRC32c is also now hardware accelerated on common CPUs so "
"it is fast. So while CRC32c is not the strongest of possible integrity "
"checks that could be used, it is more than sufficient for our needs and has "
"relatively little overhead. Adding support for larger integrity fields and/"
"or algorithms does really provide any extra value over CRC32c, but it does "
"add a lot of complexity and so there is no provision for changing the "
"integrity checking mechanism."

"Self describing metadata needs to contain enough information so that the "
"metadata block can be verified as being in the correct place without needing "
"to look at any other metadata. This means it needs to contain location "
"information. Just adding a block number to the metadata is not sufficient to "
"protect against mis-directed writes - a write might be misdirected to the "
"wrong LUN and so be written to the \"correct block\" of the wrong "
"filesystem. Hence location information must contain a filesystem identifier "
"as well as a block number."
msgstr ""

"Another key information point in forensic analysis is knowing who the "
"metadata block belongs to. We already know the type, the location, that it "
"is valid and/or corrupted, and how long ago that it was last modified. "
"Knowing the owner of the block is important as it allows us to find other "
"related metadata to determine the scope of the corruption. For example, if "
"we have a extent btree object, we don't know what inode it belongs to and "
"hence have to walk the entire filesystem to find the owner of the block. "
"Worse, the corruption could mean that no owner can be found (i.e. it's an "
"orphan block), and so without an owner field in the metadata we have no idea "
"of the scope of the corruption. If we have an owner field in the metadata "
"object, we can immediately do top down validation to determine the scope of "
"the problem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/xfs/xfs-self-describing-metadata.rst:116
msgid ""
"Different types of metadata have different owner identifiers. For example, "
"directory, attribute and extent tree blocks are all owned by an inode, while "
"freespace btree blocks are owned by an allocation group. Hence the size and "
"contents of the owner field are determined by the type of metadata object we "
"are looking at.  The owner information can also identify misplaced writes (e."
"g. freespace btree block written to the wrong AG)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/xfs/xfs-self-describing-metadata.rst:123
msgid ""
"Self describing metadata also needs to contain some indication of when it "
"was written to the filesystem. One of the key information points when doing "
"forensic analysis is how recently the block was modified. Correlation of set "
"of corrupted metadata blocks based on modification times is important as it "
"can indicate whether the corruptions are related, whether there's been "
"multiple corruption events that lead to the eventual failure, and even "
"whether there are corruptions present that the run-time verification is not "
"detecting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/xfs/xfs-self-describing-metadata.rst:131

"For example, we can determine whether a metadata object is supposed to be "
"free space or still allocated if it is still referenced by its owner by "
"looking at when the free space btree block that contains the block was last "
"written compared to when the metadata object itself was last written.  If "
"the free space block is more recent than the object and the object's owner, "
"then there is a very good chance that the block should have been removed "
"from the owner."

"To provide this \"written timestamp\", each metadata block gets the Log "
"Sequence Number (LSN) of the most recent transaction it was modified on "
"written into it. This number will always increase over the life of the "
"filesystem, and the only thing that resets it is running xfs_repair on the "
"filesystem. Further, by use of the LSN we can tell if the corrupted metadata "
"all belonged to the same log checkpoint and hence have some idea of how much "
"modification occurred between the first and last instance of corrupt "
"metadata on disk and, further, how much modification occurred between the "
"corruption being written and when it was detected."

"The verification is completely stateless - it is done independently of the "
"modification process, and seeks only to check that the metadata is what it "
"says it is and that the metadata fields are within bounds and internally "
"consistent. As such, we cannot catch all types of corruption that can occur "
"within a block as there may be certain limitations that operational state "
"enforces of the metadata, or there may be corruption of interblock "

"For read verification, the caller needs to specify the expected type of "

"fails, then it marks the object being read as EFSCORRUPTED. The caller needs "
"to catch this error (same as for IO errors), and if it needs to take special "

"error value. If we need more discrimination of error type at higher levels, "

"The first step in read verification is checking the magic number and "
"determining whether CRC validating is necessary. If it is, the CRC32c is "
