"The w1_ds2406 driver allows connected devices to be switched on and off. "
"These chips also provide 128 bytes of OTP EPROM, but reading/writing it is "
"not supported.  In TSOC-6 form, the DS2406 provides two switch outputs and "
"can be provided with power on a dedicated input.  In TO-92 form, it provides "
"one output and uses parasitic power only."

"The driver provides two sysfs files.  state is readable; it gives the "
"current state of each switch, with PIO A in bit 0 and PIO B in bit 1.  The "
"driver ORs this state with 0x30, so shell scripts get an ASCII 0/1/2/3 to "
"work with.  output is writable; bits 0 and 1 control PIO A and B, "
"respectively.  Bits 2-7 are ignored, so it's safe to write ASCII data."

"CRCs are checked on read and write.  Failed checks cause an I/O error to be "
