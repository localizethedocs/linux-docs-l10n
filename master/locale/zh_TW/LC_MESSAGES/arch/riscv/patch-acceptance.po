"The RISC-V instruction set architecture is developed in the open: in-"
"progress drafts are available for all to review and to experiment with "
"implementations.  New module or extension drafts can change during the "
"development process - sometimes in ways that are incompatible with previous "
"drafts.  This flexibility can present a challenge for RISC-V Linux "
"maintenance.  Linux maintainers disapprove of churn, and the Linux "
"development process prefers well-reviewed and tested code over experimental "
"code.  We wish to extend these same principles to the RISC-V-related code "
"that will be accepted for inclusion in the kernel."

"Automation runs against this patchwork instance, building/testing patches as "
"they arrive. The automation applies patches against the current HEAD of the "
"RISC-V `for-next` and `fixes` branches, depending on whether the patch has "
"been detected as a fix. Failing those, it will use the RISC-V `master` "
"branch. The exact commit to which a series has been applied will be noted on "
"patchwork. Patches for which any of the checks fail are unlikely to be "
"applied and in most cases will need to be resubmitted."

"We'll only accept patches for new modules or extensions if the "
