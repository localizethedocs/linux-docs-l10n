"Device-tree compatible SH bootloaders are expected to provide the physical "
"address of the device tree blob in r4. Since legacy bootloaders did not "
"guarantee any particular initial register state, kernels built to inter-"
"operate with old bootloaders must either use a builtin DTB or select a "
"legacy board option (something other than CONFIG_SH_DEVICE_TREE) that does "
"not use device tree. Support for the latter is being phased out in favor of "
"device tree."
