"This is a LED trigger useful for signaling the user of an event where there "
"are no clear trap points to put standard led-on and led-off settings.  Using "
"this trigger, the application needs only to signal the trigger when an event "
"has happened, then the trigger turns the LED on and then keeps it off for a "
"specified amount of time."

"This trigger is meant to be usable both for sporadic and dense events.  In "
"the first case, the trigger produces a clear single controlled blink for "
"each event, while in the latter it keeps blinking at constant rate, as to "
"signal that the events are arriving continuously."

"A one-shot LED only stays in a constant state when there are no events.  An "
"additional \"invert\" property specifies if the LED has to stay off (normal) "
"or on (inverted) when not rearmed."
