"The MT6370 integrates a four-channel RGB LED driver, designed to provide a "
"variety of lighting effect for mobile device applications. The RGB LED "
"devices includes a smart LED string controller and it can drive 3 channels "
"of LEDs with a sink current up to 24mA and a CHG_VIN power good indicator "
"LED with sink current up to 6mA. It provides three operation modes for RGB "
"LEDs: PWM Dimming mode, breath pattern mode, and constant current mode. The "
"device can increase or decrease the brightness of the RGB LED via an I2C "
"interface."

"The breath pattern is a series of timing pairs, with the hold-time expressed "
"in milliseconds. And the brightness is controlled by '/sys/class/leds/<led>/"
"brightness'. The pattern doesn't include the brightness setting. Hardware "
"pattern only controls the timing for each pattern stage depending on the "
"current brightness setting."
