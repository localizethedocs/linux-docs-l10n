"i2c-ocores uses the platform bus, so you need to provide a struct "
"platform_device with the base address and interrupt number. The dev."
"platform_data of the device should also point to a struct "
"ocores_i2c_platform_data (see linux/platform_data/i2c-ocores.h) describing "
"the distance between registers and the input clock speed. There is also a "
"possibility to attach a list of i2c_board_info which the i2c-ocores driver "
"will add to the bus upon creation."
