"This SMBus only driver is known to work on motherboards with the above named "
"chipset combinations. The driver was developed without benefit of a proper "
"datasheet from SiS. The SMBus registers are assumed compatible with those of "
"the SiS630, although they are located in a completely different place. "
"Thanks to Alexander Malysh <amalysh@web.de> for providing the SiS630 "
"datasheet (and  driver)."
