"Installation is simple, you only need to add Linux Input, Linux USB, and the "

"This driver appears to be one of possible 2 Linux USB Input Touchscreen "
"drivers.  Although 3M produces a binary only driver available for download, "
"I persist in updating this driver since I would like to use the touchscreen "
"for embedded apps using QTEmbedded, DirectFB, etc. So I feel the logical "
"choice is to use Linux Input."

"Currently there is no way to calibrate the device via this driver.  Even if "
"the device could be calibrated, the driver pulls to raw coordinate data from "
"the controller.  This means calibration must be performed within the "
"userspace."

"The controller screen resolution is now 0 to 16384 for both X and Y "
"reporting the raw touch data.  This is the same for the old and new "

"Perhaps at some point an abstract function will be placed into evdev so "
