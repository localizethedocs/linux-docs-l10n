"Modern SoCs typically employ heterogeneous remote processor devices in "
"asymmetric multiprocessing (AMP) configurations, which may be running "
"different instances of operating system, whether it's Linux or any other "
"flavor of real-time OS."

"OMAP4, for example, has dual Cortex-A9, dual Cortex-M3 and a C64x+ DSP. "
"Typically, the dual cortex-A9 is running Linux in a SMP configuration, and "
"each of the other three cores (two M3 cores and a DSP) is running its own "
"instance of RTOS in an AMP configuration."

"Typically AMP remote processors employ dedicated DSP codecs and multimedia "
"hardware accelerators, and therefore are often used to offload CPU-intensive "
"multimedia tasks from the main application processor."

"These remote processors could also be used to control latency-sensitive "
"sensors, drive random hardware blocks, or just perform background tasks "

"Users of those remote processors can either be userland apps (e.g. "
"multimedia frameworks talking with remote OMX components) or kernel drivers "

"Rpmsg is a virtio-based messaging bus that allows kernel drivers to "
"communicate with remote processors available on the system. In turn, drivers "
"could then expose appropriate user space interfaces, if needed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../staging/rpmsg.rst:41
msgid ""
"When writing a driver that exposes rpmsg communication to userland, please "
"keep in mind that remote processors might have direct access to the system's "
"physical memory and other sensitive hardware resources (e.g. on OMAP4, "
"remote cores and hardware accelerators may have direct access to the "
"physical memory, gpio banks, dma controllers, i2c bus, gptimers, mailbox "
"devices, hwspinlocks, etc..). Moreover, those remote processors might be "
"running RTOS where every task can access the entire memory/devices exposed "
"to the processor. To minimize the risks of rogue (or buggy) userland code "
"exploiting remote bugs, and by that taking over the system, it is often "
"desired to limit userland to specific rpmsg channels (see definition below) "
"it can send messages on, and if possible, minimize how much control it has "
"over the content of the messages."

"Every rpmsg device is a communication channel with a remote processor (thus "
"rpmsg devices are called channels). Channels are identified by a textual "
"name and have a local (\"source\") rpmsg address, and remote "
"(\"destination\") rpmsg address."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../staging/rpmsg.rst:59
msgid ""
"When a driver starts listening on a channel, its rx callback is bound with a "
"unique rpmsg local address (a 32-bit integer). This way when inbound "
"messages arrive, the rpmsg core dispatches them to the appropriate driver "
"according to their destination address (this is done by invoking the "
"driver's rx handler with the payload of the inbound message)."

"This function allows drivers to create such an endpoint, and by that, bind a "

"Simple rpmsg drivers need not call rpmsg_create_ept, because an endpoint is "

"So things should just work for simple drivers: they already have an "
"endpoint, their rx callback is bound to their rpmsg address, and when "

"That said, more complicated drivers might do need to allocate additional "
"rpmsg addresses, and bind them to different rx callbacks. To accomplish "

"channel (so the new endpoint would bind to the same remote processor their "
"channel belongs to), an rx callback function, an optional private data "
"(which is provided back when the rx callback is invoked), and an address "
"they want to bind with the callback. If addr is RPMSG_ADDR_ANY, then "
