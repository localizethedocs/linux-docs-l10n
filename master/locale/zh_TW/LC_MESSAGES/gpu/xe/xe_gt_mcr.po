"Some GT registers are designed as \"multicast\" or \"replicated\" registers: "
"multiple instances of the same register share a single MMIO offset.  MCR "
"registers are generally used when the hardware needs to potentially track "
"independent values of a register per hardware unit (e.g., per-subslice, per-"
"L3bank, etc.).  The specific types of replication that exist vary per-"
"platform."

"MMIO accesses to MCR registers are controlled according to the settings "
"programmed in the platform's MCR_SELECTOR register(s).  MMIO writes to MCR "
"registers can be done in either multicast (a single write updates all "
"instances of the register to the same value) or unicast (a write updates "
"only one specific instance) form.  Reads of MCR registers always operate in "
"a unicast manner regardless of how the multicast/unicast bit is set in "
"MCR_SELECTOR.  Selection of a specific MCR instance for unicast operations "
"is referred to as \"steering.\""

msgid ""
"If MCR register operations are steered toward a hardware unit that is fused "
"off or currently powered down due to power gating, the MMIO operation is "
"\"terminated\" by the hardware.  Terminated read operations will return a "
"value of zero and terminated unicast write operations will be silently "
"ignored. During device initialization, the goal of the various "
"``init_steering_*()`` functions is to apply the platform-specific rules for "
"each MCR register type to identify a steering target that will select a non-"
"terminated instance."
