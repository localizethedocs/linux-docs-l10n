"Every GFX has a pipe component with one or more hardware queues. Pipes can "
"switch between queues depending on certain conditions, and one of the "
"components that can request a queue switch to a pipe is the MicroEngine "
"Scheduler (MES). Whenever the driver is initialized, it creates one MQD per "
"hardware queue, and then the MQDs are handed to the MES firmware for mapping "
"to:"

"Kernel Queues (legacy): This queue is statically mapped to HQDs and never "
"preempted. Even though this is a legacy feature, it is the current default, "
"and most existing hardware supports it. When an application submits work to "
"the kernel driver, it submits all of the application command buffers to the "
"kernel queues. The CS IOCTL takes the command buffer from the applications "
"and schedules them on the kernel queue."

"User Queues: These queues are dynamically mapped to the HQDs. Regarding the "
"utilization of User Queues, the userspace application will create its user "
"queues and submit work directly to its user queues with no need to IOCTL for "
"each submission and no need to share a single kernel queue."

"In terms of User Queues, MES can dynamically map them to the HQD. If there "
"are more MQDs than HQDs, the MES firmware will preempt other user queues to "
"make sure each queues get a time slice; in other words, MES is a "
"microcontroller that handles the mapping and unmapping of MQDs into HQDs, as "
"well as the priorities and oversubscription of MQDs."
