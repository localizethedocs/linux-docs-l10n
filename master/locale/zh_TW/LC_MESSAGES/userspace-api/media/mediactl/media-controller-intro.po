"Media devices increasingly handle multiple related functions. Many USB "
"cameras include microphones, video capture hardware can also output video, "
"or SoC camera interfaces also perform memory-to-memory operations similar to "
"video codecs."

"Independent functions, even when implemented in the same hardware, can be "
"modelled as separate devices. A USB camera with a microphone will be "
"presented to userspace applications as V4L2 and ALSA capture devices. The "
"devices' relationships (when using a webcam, end-users shouldn't have to "
"manually select the associated USB microphone), while not made available "
"directly to applications by the drivers, can usually be retrieved from sysfs."

"With more and more advanced SoC devices being introduced, the current "
"approach will not scale. Device topologies are getting increasingly complex "
"and can't always be represented by a tree structure. Hardware blocks are "
"shared between different functions, creating dependencies between seemingly "
"unrelated devices."

"Kernel abstraction APIs such as V4L2 and ALSA provide means for applications "
"to access hardware parameters. As newer hardware expose an increasingly high "
"number of those parameters, drivers need to guess what applications really "
"require based on limited information, thereby implementing policies that "
"belong to userspace."
