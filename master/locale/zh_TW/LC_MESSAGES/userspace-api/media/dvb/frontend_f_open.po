"In a system with multiple front-ends, it is usually the case that multiple "
"devices cannot be open in read/write mode simultaneously. As long as a front-"
"end device is opened in read/write mode, other open() calls in read/write "
"mode will either fail or block, depending on whether non-blocking or "
"blocking mode was specified. A front-end device opened in blocking mode can "
"later be put into non-blocking mode (and vice versa) using the F_SETFL "
"command of the fcntl system call. This is a standard system call, documented "
"in the Linux manual page for fcntl. When an open() call has succeeded, the "
"device will be ready for use in the specified mode. This implies that the "
"corresponding hardware is powered up, and that other front-ends may have "
"been powered down to make that possible."
