"In this context, RF tuner is radio receiver circuit between antenna and "
"demodulator. It receives radio frequency (RF) from the antenna and converts "
"that received signal to lower intermediate frequency (IF) or baseband "
"frequency (BB). Tuners that could do baseband output are often called Zero-"
"IF tuners. Older tuners were typically simple PLL tuners inside a metal box, "
"while newer ones are highly integrated chips without a metal box \"silicon "
"tuners\". These controls are mostly applicable for new feature rich silicon "
"tuners, just because older tuners does not have much adjustable features."
