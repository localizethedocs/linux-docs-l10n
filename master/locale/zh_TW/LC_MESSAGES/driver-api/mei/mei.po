"The Intel Management Engine Interface (Intel MEI, previously known as HECI) "
"is the interface between the Host and Intel ME. This interface is exposed to "
"the host as a PCI device, actually multiple PCI devices might be exposed. "
"The Intel MEI Driver is in charge of the communication channel between a "
"host application and the Intel ME features."

"An application maintains communication with an Intel ME feature while /dev/"
"meiX is open. The binding to a specific feature is performed by calling :c:"

"depends on the Intel ME feature, but most of the features allow only a "
