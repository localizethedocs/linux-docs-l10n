"LinuxPPS provides a programming interface (API) to define in the system "
"several PPS sources."

"PPS means \"pulse per second\" and a PPS source is just a device which "
"provides a high precision signal each second so that an application can use "
"it to adjust system clock time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pps.rst:31
msgid ""
"A PPS source can be connected to a serial port (usually to the Data Carrier "
"Detect pin) or to a parallel port (ACK-pin) or to a special CPU's GPIOs "
"(this is the common case in embedded systems) but in each case when a new "
"pulse arrives the system must apply to it a timestamp and record it for "
"userland."

"Common use is the combination of the NTPD as userland program, with a GPS "

"While implementing a PPS API as RFC 2783 defines and using an embedded CPU "

"At startup it needs a file descriptor as argument for the function "
"time_pps_create()."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pps.rst:52
msgid ""
"This implies that the source has a /dev/... entry. This assumption is OK for "
"the serial and parallel port, where you can do something useful besides(!) "
"the gathering of timestamps as it is the central task for a PPS API. But "
"this assumption does not work for a single purpose GPIO line. In this case "
"even basic file-related functionality (like read() and write()) makes no "
"sense at all and should not be a precondition for the use of a PPS API."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pps.rst:60
msgid ""
"The problem can be simply solved if you consider that a PPS source is not "
"always connected with a GPS data source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pps.rst:63
msgid ""
"So your programs should check if the GPS data source (the serial port for "
"instance) is a PPS source too, and if not they should provide the "
"possibility to open another device as PPS source."

"It is possible to grab the PPS from an USB to serial device. However, you "
"should take into account the latencies and jitter introduced by the USB "

"125 microseconds."

"If your device doesn't report PPS, you can check that the feature is "
