"Exynos 4x12 (4212, 4412) and 5 series provide emulation mode for thermal "
"management unit. Thermal emulation mode supports software debug for TMU's "
"operation. User can set temperature manually with software code and TMU will "
"read current temperature from user value not from sensor's value."

"Enabling CONFIG_THERMAL_EMULATION option will make this support available. "
"When it's enabled, sysfs node will be created as /sys/devices/virtual/"

"The sysfs node, 'emul_node', will contain value 0 for the initial state. "
"When you input any temperature you want to update to sysfs node, it "
"automatically enable emulation mode and current temperature will be changed "
"into it."

"(Exynos also supports user changeable delay time which would be used to "
"delay of changing temperature. However, this node only uses same delay of "
"real sensing time, 938us.)"

"Exynos emulation mode requires synchronous of value changing and enabling. "
"It means when you want to update the any value of delay or next temperature, "
"then you have to enable emulation mode at the same time. (Or you have to "
"keep the mode enabling.) If you don't, it fails to change the value to "
"updated one and just use last succeessful value repeatedly. That's why this "
"node gives users the right to change termerpature only. Just one interface "
"makes it more simply to use."
