"The MEN Chameleon Bus is an artificial bus system that attaches to a so "
"called Chameleon FPGA device found on some hardware produced my MEN Mikro "
"Elektronik GmbH. These devices are multi-function devices implemented in a "
"single FPGA and usually attached via some sort of PCI or PCIe link. Each "
"FPGA contains a header section describing the content of the FPGA. The "
"header lists the device id, PCI BAR, offset from the beginning of the PCI "
"BAR, size in the FPGA, interrupt number and some other properties currently "
"not handled by the MCB implementation."

"A carrier device is just an abstraction for the real world physical bus the "
"Chameleon FPGA is attached to. Some IP Core drivers may need to interact "
"with properties of the carrier device (like querying the IRQ number of a PCI "
"device). To provide abstraction from the real hardware bus, an MCB carrier "
"device provides callback methods to translate the driver's MCB function "
"calls to hardware related function calls. For example a carrier device may "
"implement the get_irq() method which can be translated into a hardware bus "
"query for the IRQ number the device should use."

"The parser reads the first 512 bytes of a Chameleon device and parses the "

"of the Chameleon table but can easily be adopted to support an older or "
"possible future variant. While parsing the table's entries new MCB devices "
"are allocated and their resources are assigned according to the resource "
"assignment in the Chameleon table. After resource assignment is finished, "
"the MCB devices are registered at the MCB and thus at the driver core of the "
"Linux kernel."
