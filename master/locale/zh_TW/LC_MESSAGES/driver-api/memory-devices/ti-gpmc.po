"GPMC has certain timings that has to be programmed for proper functioning of "
"the peripheral, while peripheral has another set of timings. To have "
"peripheral work with gpmc, peripheral timings has to be translated to the "
"form gpmc can understand. The way it has to be translated depends on the "
"connected peripheral. Also there is a dependency for certain gpmc timings on "
"gpmc clock frequency. Hence a generic timing routine was developed to "
"achieve above requirements."

"Generic routine provides a generic method to calculate gpmc timings from "
"gpmc peripheral timings. struct gpmc_device_timings fields has to be updated "
"with timings from the datasheet of the peripheral that is connected to gpmc. "
"A few of the peripheral timings can be fed either in time or in cycles, "
"provision to handle this scenario has been provided (refer struct "
"gpmc_device_timings definition). It may so happen that timing as specified "
"by peripheral datasheet is not present in timing structure, in this "
"scenario, try to correlate peripheral timing to the one available. If that "
"doesn't work, try to add a new field as required by peripheral, educate "
"generic timing routine to handle it, make sure that it does not break any of "
"the existing. Then there may be cases where peripheral datasheet doesn't "
"mention certain fields of struct gpmc_device_timings, zero those entries."
