"The architecture of the USB 2.0 PHY module in Samsung SoCs is similar among "
"many SoCs. In spite of the similarities it proved difficult to create a one "
"driver that would fit all these PHY controllers. Often the differences were "
"minor and were found in particular bits of the registers of the PHY. In some "
"rare cases the order of register writes or the PHY powering up process had "
"to be altered. This adaptation layer is a compromise between having separate "
"drivers and having a single driver with added support for many special cases."

"This is the main file of the adaptation layer. This file contains the probe "
"function and provides two callbacks to the Generic PHY Framework. This two "
"callbacks are used to power on and power off the phy. They carry out the "
"common work that has to be done on all version of the PHY module. Depending "
"on which SoC was chosen they execute SoC specific callbacks. The specific "
"SoC version is selected by choosing the appropriate compatible string. In "
"addition, this file contains struct of_device_id definitions for particular "
"SoCs."
