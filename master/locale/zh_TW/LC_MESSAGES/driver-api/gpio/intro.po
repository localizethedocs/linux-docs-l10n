"A \"General Purpose Input/Output\" (GPIO) is a flexible software-controlled "
"digital signal. They are provided from many kinds of chips, and are familiar "
"to Linux developers working with embedded and custom hardware. Each GPIO "
"represents a bit connected to a particular pin, or \"ball\" on Ball Grid "
"Array (BGA) packages. Board schematics show which external hardware connects "
"to which GPIOs. Drivers can be written generically, so that board setup code "
"passes such pin configuration data to drivers."

"System-on-Chip (SOC) processors heavily rely on GPIOs. In some cases, every "
"non-dedicated pin can be configured as a GPIO; and most chips have at least "
"several dozen of them. Programmable logic devices (like FPGAs) can easily "
"provide GPIOs; multifunction chips like power managers, and audio codecs "
"often have a few such pins to help with pin scarcity on SOCs; and there are "
"also \"GPIO Expander\" chips that connect using the I2C or SPI serial buses. "
"Most PC southbridges have a few dozen GPIO-capable pins (with only the BIOS "
"firmware knowing how they're used)."

"Output values are writable (high=1, low=0). Some chips also have options "
"about how that value is driven, so that for example only one value might be "
"driven, supporting \"wire-OR\" and similar schemes for the other value "
"(notably, \"open drain\" signaling)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Input values are likewise readable (1, 0). Some chips support readback of "
"pins configured as \"output\", which is very useful in such \"wire-OR\" "
"cases (to support bidirectional signaling). GPIO controllers may have input "
"de-glitch/debounce logic, sometimes with software controls."

"Inputs can often be used as IRQ signals, often edge triggered but sometimes "

"It is natural to assume that a GPIO is \"active\" when its output signal is "
"1 (\"high\"), and inactive when it is 0 (\"low\"). However in practice the "
"signal of a GPIO may be inverted before is reaches its destination, or a "
"device could decide to have different conventions about what \"active\" "
"means. Such decisions should be transparent to device drivers, therefore it "
"is possible to define a GPIO as being either active-high (\"1\" means "
"\"active\", the default) or active-low (\"0\" means \"active\") so that "
"drivers only need to worry about the logical signal and not about what "
"happens at the line level."

msgid ""
"Sometimes shared signals need to use \"open drain\" (where only the low "
"signal level is actually driven), or \"open source\" (where only the high "
"signal level is driven) signaling. That term applies to CMOS transistors; "
"\"open collector\" is used for TTL. A pullup or pulldown resistor causes the "
"high or low signal level. This is sometimes called a \"wire-AND\"; or more "
"practically, from the negative logic (low=true) perspective this is a \"wire-"
"OR\"."

"One common example of an open drain signal is a shared active-low IRQ line. "
"Also, bidirectional data bus signals sometimes use open drain signals."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some GPIO controllers directly support open drain and open source outputs; "
"many don't. When you need open drain signaling but your hardware doesn't "
"directly support it, there's a common idiom you can use to emulate it with "
"any GPIO pin that can be used as either an input or an output:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/gpio/intro.rst:97
msgid ""
"**LOW**: ``gpiod_direction_output(gpio, 0)`` ... this drives the signal and "
"overrides the pullup."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/gpio/intro.rst:100
msgid ""
"**HIGH**: ``gpiod_direction_input(gpio)`` ... this turns off the output, so "
"the pullup (or some other device) controls the signal."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/gpio/intro.rst:103
msgid ""
"The same logic can be applied to emulate open source signaling, by driving "
"the high signal and configuring the GPIO as input for low. This open drain/"
"open source emulation can be handled transparently by the GPIO framework."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/gpio/intro.rst:107
msgid ""
"If you are \"driving\" the signal high but gpiod_get_value(gpio) reports a "
"low value (after the appropriate rise time passes), you know some other "
"component is driving the shared signal low. That's not necessarily an error. "
"As one common example, that's how I2C clocks are stretched:  a slave that "
"needs a slower clock delays the rising edge of SCK, and the I2C master "
"adjusts its signaling rate accordingly."
