"This feature provides a generic infrastructure within the Linux kernel to "
"track and log recoverable hardware errors. These are hardware recoverable "
"errors visible that might not cause immediate panics but may influence "
"health, mainly because new code path will be executed in the kernel."

#: ../../../driver-api/hw-recoverable-errors.rst:15
msgid ""
"By recording counts and timestamps of recoverable errors into the vmcoreinfo "
"crash dump notes, this infrastructure aids post-mortem crash analysis tools "
"in correlating hardware events with kernel failures. This enables faster "
"triage and better understanding of root causes, especially in large-scale "
"cloud environments where hardware issues are common."

#: ../../../driver-api/hw-recoverable-errors.rst:24
msgid ""
"Facilitates correlation of hardware recoverable errors with kernel panics or "
"unusual code paths that lead to system crashes."

"Provides operators and cloud providers quick insights, improving reliability "
"and reducing troubleshooting time."

"The tracked error data consists of per-error-type counts and timestamps of "
"last occurrence."

#: ../../../driver-api/hw-recoverable-errors.rst:35

"This data is stored in the `hwerror_data` array, categorized by error source "
"types like CPU, memory, PCI, CXL, and others."

#: ../../../driver-api/hw-recoverable-errors.rst:37
msgid ""
"It is exposed via vmcoreinfo crash dump notes and can be read using tools "

msgid "There is no other way to read these data other than from crash dumps."

"These errors are divided by area, which includes CPU, Memory, PCI, CXL and "
