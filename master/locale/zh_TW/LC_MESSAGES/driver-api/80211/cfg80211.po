"cfg80211 is the configuration API for 802.11 devices in Linux. It bridges "
"userspace and drivers, and offers some utility functionality associated with "
"802.11. cfg80211 must, directly or indirectly via mac80211, be used by all "
"modern wireless drivers in Linux, so that they offer a consistent API "
"through nl80211. For backward compatibility, cfg80211 also offers wireless "
"extensions to userspace, but hides them from drivers completely."
