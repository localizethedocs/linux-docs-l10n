"Firmware can be built-in to the kernel, this means building the firmware "
"into vmlinux directly, to enable avoiding having to look for firmware from "
"the filesystem. Instead, firmware can be looked for inside the kernel "
"directly. You can enable built-in firmware using the kernel configuration "
"options:"
