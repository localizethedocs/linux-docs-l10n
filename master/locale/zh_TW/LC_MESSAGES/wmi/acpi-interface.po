"The ACPI WMI interface is a proprietary extension of the ACPI specification "
"made by Microsoft to allow hardware vendors to embed WMI (Windows Management "
"Instrumentation) objects inside their ACPI firmware. Typical functions "
"implemented over ACPI WMI are hotkey events on modern notebooks and "
"configuration of BIOS options."
