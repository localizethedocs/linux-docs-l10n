"PCIe error signaling can occur on the PCIe link itself or on behalf of "
"transactions initiated on the link. PCIe defines two error reporting "
"paradigms: the baseline capability and the Advanced Error Reporting "
"capability. The baseline capability is required of all PCIe components "
"providing a minimum defined set of error reporting requirements. Advanced "
"Error Reporting capability is implemented with a PCIe Advanced Error "
"Reporting extended capability structure providing more robust error "

"Some systems have AER support in firmware. Enabling Linux AER support at the "

"PCIe errors are classified into two types: correctable errors and "

"Unlike correctable errors, uncorrectable errors impact functionality of the "
"interface. Uncorrectable errors can cause a particular transaction or a "
"particular PCIe link to be unreliable. Depending on those error conditions, "
"uncorrectable errors are further classified into non-fatal errors and fatal "
"errors. Non-fatal errors cause the particular transaction to be unreliable, "

"hand, cause the link to be unreliable."

"When PCIe error reporting is enabled, a device will automatically send an "
"error message to the Root Port above it when it captures an error. The Root "
"Port, upon receiving an error reporting message, internally processes and "
"logs the error message in its AER Capability structure. Error information "
"being logged includes storing the error reporting agent's requestor ID into "
"the Error Source Identification Registers and setting the error bits of the "
"Root Error Status Register accordingly. If AER error reporting is enabled in "

"an error is detected."
