"The DS1621 is a (one instance) digital thermometer and thermostat. It has "
"both high and low temperature limits which can be user defined (i.e. "
"programmed into non-volatile on-chip registers). Temperature range is -55 "
"degree Celsius to +125 in 0.5 increments. You may convert this into a "
"Fahrenheit range of -67 to +257 degrees with 0.9 steps. If polarity "
"parameter is not provided, original value is used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/ds1621.rst:71
msgid ""
"As for the thermostat, behavior can also be programmed using the polarity "
"toggle. On the one hand (\"heater\"), the thermostat output of the chip, "
"Tout, will trigger when the low limit temperature is met or underrun and "
"stays high until the high limit is met or exceeded. On the other hand "
"(\"cooler\"), vice versa. That way \"heater\" equals \"active low\", whereas "
"\"conditioner\" equals \"active high\". Please note that the DS1621 data "
"sheet is somewhat misleading in this point since setting the polarity bit "
"does not simply invert Tout."

"A second thing is that, during extensive testing, Tout showed a tolerance of "
"up to +/- 0.5 degrees even when compared against precise temperature "
"readings. Be sure to have a high vs. low temperature limit gap of al least "
"1.0 degree Celsius to avoid Tout \"bouncing\", though!"

"The alarm registers are in no way suitable to find out about the actual "
"status of Tout. They will only tell you about its history, whether or not "
"any of the limits have ever been met or exceeded since last power-up or "

"with neither of the alarms set."

"Since there is no version or vendor identification register, there is no "
