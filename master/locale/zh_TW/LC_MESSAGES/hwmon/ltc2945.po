"Voltage readings provided by this driver are reported as obtained from the "
"ADC registers. If a set of voltage divider resistors is installed, calculate "
"the real voltage by multiplying the reported value with (R1+R2)/R2, where R1 "
"is the value of the divider resistor against the measured voltage and R2 is "
"the value of the divider resistor against Ground."
