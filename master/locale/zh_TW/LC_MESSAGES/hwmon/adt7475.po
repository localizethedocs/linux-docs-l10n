"This driver implements support for the Analog Devices ADT7473, ADT7475, "
"ADT7476 and ADT7490 chip family. The ADT7473 and ADT7475 differ only in "
"minor details. The ADT7476 has additional features, including extra voltage "
"measurement inputs and VID support. The ADT7490 also has additional "
"features, including extra voltage measurement inputs and PECI support. All "
"the supported chips will be collectively designed by the name \"ADT747x\" in "
"the rest of this document."

"The ADT747x uses the 2-wire interface compatible with the SMBus 2.0 "
"specification. Using an analog to digital converter it measures three (3) "
"temperatures and two (2) or more voltages. It has four (4) 16-bit counters "
"for measuring fan speed. There are three (3) PWM outputs that can be used to "
"control fan speed."

"A sophisticated control system for the PWM outputs is designed into the "
"ADT747x that allows fan speed to be adjusted automatically based on any of "
"the three temperature sensors. Each PWM output is individually adjustable "

"in response to the measured temperatures without further host intervention. "
