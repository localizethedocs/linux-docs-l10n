"This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor LM85 and "

"SMSC EMC6D10x chips family."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm85.rst:92
msgid ""
"The LM85 uses the 2-wire interface compatible with the SMBUS 2.0 "
"specification. Using an analog to digital converter it measures three (3) "
"temperatures and five (5) voltages. It has four (4) 16-bit counters for "
"measuring fan speed. Five (5) digital inputs are provided for sampling the "
"VID signals from the processor to the VRM. Lastly, there are three (3) PWM "
"outputs that can be used to control fan speed."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The temperatures measured are one internal diode, and two remote diodes. "
"Remote 1 is generally the CPU temperature. These inputs are designed to "
"measure a thermal diode like the one in a Pentium 4 processor in a socket "
"423 or socket 478 package. They can also measure temperature using a "
"transistor like the 2N3904."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm85.rst:110
msgid ""
"A sophisticated control system for the PWM outputs is designed into the LM85 "
"that allows fan speed to be adjusted automatically based on any of the three "
"temperature sensors. Each PWM output is individually adjustable and "
"programmable. Once configured, the LM85 will adjust the PWM outputs in "
"response to the measured temperatures without further host intervention. "
"This feature can also be disabled for manual control of the PWM's."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm85.rst:121
msgid ""
"The LM85 samples all inputs continuously. The lm85 driver will not read the "
"registers more often than once a second. Further, configuration data is only "
"read once each 5 minutes. There is twice as much config data as "
"measurements, so this would seem to be a worthwhile optimization."

msgid ""
"The LM85 has four fan speed monitoring modes. The ADM1027 has only two. Both "
"have special circuitry to compensate for PWM interactions with the TACH "
"signal from the fans. The ADM1027 can be configured to measure the speed of "
"a two wire fan, but the input conditioning circuitry is different for 3-wire "
"and 2-wire mode. For this reason, the 2-wire fan modes are not exposed to "
"user control. The BIOS should initialize them to the correct mode. If you've "
"designed your own ADM1027, you'll have to modify the init_client function "
"and add an insmod parameter to set this up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm85.rst:138
msgid ""
"To smooth the response of fans to changes in temperature, the LM85 has an "
"optional filter for smoothing temperatures. The ADM1027 has the same config "
"option but uses it to rate limit the changes to fan speed instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm85.rst:142
msgid ""
"The ADM1027, ADT7463 and ADT7468 have a 10-bit ADC and can therefore measure "
"temperatures with 0.25 degC resolution. They also provide an offset to the "
"temperature readings that is automatically applied during measurement. This "
"offset can be used to zero out any errors due to traces and placement. The "
"documentation says that the offset is in 0.25 degC steps, but in initial "
"testing of the ADM1027 it was 1.00 degC steps. Analog Devices has confirmed "
"this \"bug\". The ADT7463 is reported to work as described in the "
"documentation. The current lm85 driver does not show the offset register."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm85.rst:152
msgid ""
"The ADT7468 has a high-frequency PWM mode, where all PWM outputs are driven "
"by a 22.5 kHz clock. This is a global mode, not per-PWM output, which means "
"that setting any PWM frequency above 11.3 kHz will switch all 3 PWM outputs "
"to a 22.5 kHz frequency. Conversely, setting any PWM frequency below 11.3 "
"kHz will switch all 3 PWM outputs to a frequency between 10 and 100 Hz, "
"which can then be tuned separately."

"See the vendor datasheets for more information. There is application note "

"The SMSC EMC6D100 & EMC6D101 monitor external voltages, temperatures, and "
"fan speeds. They use this monitoring capability to alert the system to out "
"of limit conditions and can automatically control the speeds of multiple "
"fans in a PC or embedded system. The EMC6D101, available in a 24-pin SSOP "
"package, and the EMC6D100, available in a 28-pin SSOP package, are designed "
"to be register compatible. The EMC6D100 offers all the features of the "
"EMC6D101 plus additional voltage monitoring and system control features. "
"Unfortunately it is not possible to distinguish between the package versions "
"on register level so these additional voltage inputs may read zero. EMC6D102 "

"and temperature channels."
