"This driver implements monitoring and control of fans plugged into the "
"device. Besides typical speed monitoring and PWM duty cycle control, voltage "
"and current is reported for every fan."

"The device also has two connectors for RGB LEDs; support for them isn't "
"implemented (mainly because there is no standardized sysfs interface)."

#: ../../../hwmon/nzxt-smart2.rst:21

"Also, the device has a noise sensor, but the sensor seems to be completely "
"useless (and very imprecise), so support for it isn't implemented too."

msgid ""
"If fans are plugged in/unplugged while the system is powered on, the driver "
"must be reloaded to detect configuration changes; otherwise, new fans can't "
"be controlled (`pwm*` changes will be ignored). It is necessary because the "
"device has a dedicated \"detect fans\" command, and currently, it is "
"executed only during initialization. Speed, voltage, current monitoring will "
"work even without reload. As an alternative to reloading the module, a "
"userspace tool (like `liquidctl`_) can be used to run \"detect fans\" "
"command through hidraw interface."
