"This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor LM80. It is "
"described as a 'Serial Interface ACPI-Compatible Microprocessor System "
"Hardware Monitor'. The LM96080 is a more recent incarnation, it is pin and "
"register compatible, with a few additional features not yet supported by the "
"driver."

"The LM80 implements one temperature sensor, two fan rotation speed sensors, "
"seven voltage sensors, alarms, and some miscellaneous stuff."

"Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. There are two sets of limits "
"which operate independently. When the HOT Temperature Limit is crossed, this "
"will cause an alarm that will be reasserted until the temperature drops "
"below the HOT Hysteresis. The Overtemperature Shutdown (OS) limits should "
"work in the same way (but this must be checked; the datasheet is unclear "
"about this). Measurements are guaranteed between -55 and +125 degrees. The "
"current temperature measurement has a resolution of 0.0625 degrees; the "
"limits have a resolution of 1 degree."

"Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is "
"triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. Fan "
"readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4 or 8) to give the "
"readings more range or accuracy. Not all RPM values can accurately be "
"represented, so some rounding is done. With a divider of 2, the lowest "
"representable value is around 2600 RPM."

msgid ""
"Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in volts. An "
"alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum or "
"maximum limit. Note that minimum in this case always means 'closest to "
"zero'; this is important for negative voltage measurements. All voltage "
"inputs can measure voltages between 0 and 2.55 volts, with a resolution of "
"0.01 volt."

"If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register "
"is read at least once. This means that the cause for the alarm may already "
"have disappeared! Note that in the current implementation, all hardware "
"registers are read whenever any data is read (unless it is less than 2.0 "
"seconds since the last update). This means that you can easily miss once-"
"only alarms."

"The LM80 only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often "
"will do no harm, but will return 'old' values."
