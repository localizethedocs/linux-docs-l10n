"BPF Kernel Functions or more commonly known as kfuncs are functions in the "
"Linux kernel which are exposed for use by BPF programs. Unlike normal BPF "
"helpers, kfuncs do not have a stable interface and can change from one "
"kernel release to another. Hence, BPF programs need to be updated in "
"response to changes in the kernel. See :ref:"
