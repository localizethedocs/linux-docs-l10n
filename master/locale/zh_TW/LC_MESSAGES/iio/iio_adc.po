"ADCs can have distinct types of inputs, each of them measuring analog "
"voltages in a slightly different way. An ADC digitizes the analog input "
"voltage over a span that is often given by the provided voltage reference, "
"the input type, and the input polarity. The input range allowed to an ADC "
"channel is needed to determine the scale factor and offset needed to obtain "
"the measured value in real-world units (millivolts for voltage measurement, "
"milliamps for current measurement, etc.)."

"For a **single-ended bipolar** channel, the analog voltage input can go from "

"ADC chips derive the lower reference from +VREF, others get it from a "

"single-ended true bipolar. Also, while there is a relevant difference "
"between bipolar and true bipolar from the electrical perspective, IIO makes "

"For **differential unipolar** channels, the analog voltage at the positive "
"input must also be higher than the voltage at the negative input. Thus, the "
"actual input range allowed to a differential unipolar channel is IN- to "
"+VREF. Because IN+ is allowed to swing with the measured analog signal and "
"the input setup must guarantee IN+ will not go below IN- (nor IN- will raise "
"above IN+), most differential unipolar channel setups have IN- fixed to a "
"known voltage that does not fall within the voltage range expected for the "
"measured signal. That leads to a setup that is equivalent to a pseudo-"
"differential channel. Thus, differential unipolar setups can often be "

"There is a third ADC input type which is called pseudo-differential or "
"single-ended to differential configuration. A pseudo-differential channel is "
"similar to a differential channel in that it also measures IN+ relative to "
"IN-. However, unlike bipolar differential channels, the negative input is "
"limited to a narrow voltage range (taken as a constant voltage) while only "
"IN+ is allowed to swing. A pseudo-differential channel can be made out from "
"a differential pair of inputs by restricting the negative input to a known "
"voltage while allowing only the positive input to swing. Sometimes, the "
"input provided to IN- is called common-mode voltage. Besides, some parts "
"have a COM pin that allows single-ended inputs to be referenced to a common-"
"mode voltage, making them pseudo-differential channels. Often, the common "
"mode input voltage can be described in the device tree as a voltage "
"regulator (e.g. ``com-supply``) since it is basically a constant voltage "
"source."
