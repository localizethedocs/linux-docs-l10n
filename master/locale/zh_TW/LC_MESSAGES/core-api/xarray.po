"The XArray is an abstract data type which behaves like a very large array of "
"pointers.  It meets many of the same needs as a hash or a conventional "
"resizable array.  Unlike a hash, it allows you to sensibly go to the next or "
"previous entry in a cache-efficient manner.  In contrast to a resizable "
"array, there is no need to copy data or change MMU mappings in order to grow "
"the array.  It is more memory-efficient, parallelisable and cache friendly "
"than a doubly-linked list.  It takes advantage of RCU to perform lookups "
"without locking."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/xarray.rst:21
msgid ""
"The XArray implementation is efficient when the indices used are densely "
"clustered; hashing the object and using the hash as the index will not "
"perform well.  The XArray is optimised for small indices, but still has good "
"performance with large indices.  If your index can be larger than "
"``ULONG_MAX`` then the XArray is not the data type for you.  The most "
"important user of the XArray is the page cache."

"Normal pointers may be stored in the XArray directly.  They must be 4-byte "
"aligned, which is true for any pointer returned from kmalloc() and "
"alloc_page().  It isn't true for arbitrary user-space pointers, nor for "
"function pointers.  You can store pointers to statically allocated objects, "
"as long as those objects have an alignment of at least 4."

"You can also store integers between 0 and ``LONG_MAX`` in the XArray. You "
"must first convert it into an entry using xa_mk_value(). When you retrieve "
"an entry from the XArray, you can check whether it is a value entry by "
"calling xa_is_value(), and convert it back to an integer by calling "
"xa_to_value()."

"Some users want to tag the pointers they store in the XArray.  You can call "
"xa_tag_pointer() to create an entry with a tag, xa_untag_pointer() to turn a "
"tagged entry back into an untagged pointer and xa_pointer_tag() to retrieve "
"the tag of an entry.  Tagged pointers use the same bits that are used to "
"distinguish value entries from normal pointers, so you must decide whether "
"you want to store value entries or tagged pointers in any particular XArray."

"An unusual feature of the XArray is the ability to create entries which "
"occupy a range of indices.  Once stored to, looking up any index in the "
"range will return the same entry as looking up any other index in the "
"range.  Storing to any index will store to all of them.  Multi-index entries "
"can be explicitly split into smaller entries. Unsetting (using xa_erase() or "
"xa_store() with ``NULL``) any entry will cause the XArray to forget about "

"between an entry that has never been stored to and one that has been erased "

"Calling xa_store_range() stores the same entry in a range of indices.  If "

"Sometimes you need to ensure that a subsequent call to xa_store() will not "

"entry at the indicated index.  Users of the normal API will see this entry "
"as containing ``NULL``.  If you do not need to use the reserved entry, you "
"can call xa_release() to remove the unused entry.  If another user has "
