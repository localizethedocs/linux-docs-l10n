"The Maple Tree is a B-Tree data type which is optimized for storing non-"
"overlapping ranges, including ranges of size 1.  The tree was designed to be "
"simple to use and does not require a user written search method.  It "
"supports iterating over a range of entries and going to the previous or next "
"entry in a cache-efficient manner.  The tree can also be put into an RCU-"
"safe mode of operation which allows reading and writing concurrently.  "
"Writers must synchronize on a lock, which can be the default spinlock, or "
"the user can set the lock to an external lock of a different type."

"The Maple Tree maintains a small memory footprint and was designed to use "
"modern processor cache efficiently.  The majority of the users will be able "
"to use the normal API.  An :ref:`maple-tree-advanced-api` exists for more "
"complex scenarios.  The most important usage of the Maple Tree is the "
"tracking of the virtual memory areas."

"The Maple Tree can store values between ``0`` and ``ULONG_MAX``.  The Maple "
"Tree reserves values with the bottom two bits set to '10' which are below "
"4096 (ie 2, 6, 10 .. 4094) for internal use.  If the entries may use "
"reserved entries then the users can convert the entries using xa_mk_value() "
"and convert them back by calling xa_to_value().  If the user needs to use a "
"reserved value, then the user can convert the value when using the :ref:"
"`maple-tree-advanced-api`, but are blocked by the normal API."

"Start by initialising a maple tree, either with DEFINE_MTREE() for "
"statically allocated maple trees or mt_init() for dynamically allocated "
"ones.  A freshly-initialised maple tree contains a ``NULL`` pointer for the "
"range ``0`` - ``ULONG_MAX``.  There are currently two types of maple trees "
"supported: the allocation tree and the regular tree.  The regular tree has a "
"higher branching factor for internal nodes.  The allocation tree has a lower "
"branching factor but allows the user to search for a gap of a given size or "
"larger from either ``0`` upwards or ``ULONG_MAX`` down.  An allocation tree "
"can be used by passing in the ``MT_FLAGS_ALLOC_RANGE`` flag when "
"initialising the tree."

"You can then set entries using mtree_store() or mtree_store_range(). "
"mtree_store() will overwrite any entry with the new entry and return 0 on "
"success or an error code otherwise.  mtree_store_range() works in the same "
"way but takes a range.  mtree_load() is used to retrieve the entry stored at "
"a given index.  You can use mtree_erase() to erase an entire range by only "
"knowing one value within that range, or mtree_store() call with an entry of "
