"This facility appears as a pipe that is opened in a special mode.  The "
"pipe's internal ring buffer is used to hold messages that are generated by "
"the kernel. These messages are then read out by read().  Splice and similar "
"are disabled on such pipes due to them wanting to, under some circumstances, "
"revert their additions to the ring - which might end up interleaved with "
"notification messages."

"The owner of the pipe has to tell the kernel which sources it would like to "
