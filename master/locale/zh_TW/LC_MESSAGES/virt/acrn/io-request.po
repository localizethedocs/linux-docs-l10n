"An I/O request of a User VM, which is constructed by the hypervisor, is "
"distributed by the ACRN Hypervisor Service Module to an I/O client "
"corresponding to the address range of the I/O request. Details of I/O "
"request handling are described in the following sections."

"For each User VM, there is a shared 4-KByte memory region used for I/O "
"requests communication between the hypervisor and Service VM. An I/O request "
"is a 256-byte structure buffer, which is 'struct acrn_io_request', that is "
"filled by an I/O handler of the hypervisor when a trapped I/O access happens "
"in a User VM. ACRN userspace in the Service VM first allocates a 4-KByte "
"page and passes the GPA (Guest Physical Address) of the buffer to the "
"hypervisor. The buffer is used as an array of 16 I/O request slots with each "
"I/O request slot being 256 bytes. This array is indexed by vCPU ID."

"An I/O client is responsible for handling User VM I/O requests whose "

"associated with each User VM. There is a special client associated with each "
"User VM, called the default client, that handles all I/O requests that do "
"not fit into the range of any other clients. The ACRN userspace acts as the "
"default client for each User VM."
