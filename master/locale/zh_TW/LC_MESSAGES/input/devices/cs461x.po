"This is a new low-level driver to support analog joystick attached to "
"Crystal SoundFusion CS4610/CS4612/CS4615. This code is based upon Vortex/"
"Solo drivers as an example of decoration style, and ALSA 0.5.8a kernel "
"drivers as an chipset documentation and samples."

"This version does not have cooked mode support; the basic code is present "
"here, but have not tested completely. The button analysis is completed in "
"this mode, but the axis movement is not."

"Raw mode works fine with analog joystick front-end driver and cs461x driver "
"as a backend. I've tested this driver with CS4610, 4-axis and 4-button "
"joystick; I mean the jstest utility. Also I've tried to play in xracer game "
"using joystick, and the result is better than keyboard only mode."

"The sensitivity and calibrate quality have not been tested; the two reasons "
"are performed: the same hardware cannot work under Win95 (blue screen in "
"VJOYD); I have no documentation on my chip; and the existing behavior in my "
"case was not raised the requirement of joystick calibration. So the driver "
"have no code to perform hardware related calibration."

"PnP ISA cards supported."

"The driver works with ALSA drivers simultaneously. For example, the xracer "
"uses joystick as input device and PCM device as sound output in one time. "
"There are no sound or input collisions detected. The source code have "
"comments about them; but I've found the joystick can be initialized "
"separately of ALSA modules. So, you can use only one joystick driver without "
"ALSA drivers. The ALSA drivers are not needed to compile or run this driver."

"There are no debug information print have been placed in source, and no "
"specific options required to work this driver. The found chipset parameters "
"are printed via printk(KERN_INFO \"...\"), see the /var/log/messages to "
"inspect cs461x: prefixed messages to determine possible card detection "
"errors."
