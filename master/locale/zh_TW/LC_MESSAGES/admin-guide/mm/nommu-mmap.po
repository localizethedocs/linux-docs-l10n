"The kernel has limited support for memory mapping under no-MMU conditions, "
"such as are used in uClinux environments. From the userspace point of view, "
"memory mapping is made use of in conjunction with the mmap() system call, "
"the shmat() call and the execve() system call. From the kernel's point of "
"view, execve() mapping is actually performed by the binfmt drivers, which "
"call back into the mmap() routines to do the actual work."
