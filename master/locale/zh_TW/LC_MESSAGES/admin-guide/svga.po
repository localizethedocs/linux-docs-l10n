"This small document describes the \"Video Mode Selection\" feature which "
"allows the use of various special video modes supported by the video BIOS. "
"Due to usage of the BIOS, the selection is limited to boot time (before the "
"kernel decompression starts) and works only on 80X86 machines that are "
"booted through BIOS firmware (as opposed to through UEFI, kexec, etc.)."

"Short intro for the impatient: Just use vga=ask for the first time, enter "
"``scan`` on the video mode prompt, pick the mode you want to use, remember "
"its mode ID (the four-digit hexadecimal number) and then set the vga "
"parameter to this number (converted to decimal first)."

"The video mode to be used is selected by a kernel parameter which can be "

"\" option of LILO (or some other boot loader you use) or by the \"xrandr\" "
"utility (present in standard Linux utility packages). You can use the "

"The ASK_VGA mode causes the kernel to offer a video mode menu upon bootup. "
"It displays a \"Press <RETURN> to see video modes available, <SPACE> to "

"menu, if you press <SPACE> or wait 30 seconds, the kernel will boot up in "

"<name-of-detected-video-adapter> tells what video adapter did Linux detect "

"VGA with VESA-compliant BIOS]) or a chipset name (e.g., Trident). Direct "
"detection of chipsets is turned off by default as it's inherently unreliable "

"\"0  0F00  80x25\" means that the first menu item (the menu items are "

"The mode list usually contains a few basic modes and some VESA modes.  In "
"case your chipset has been detected, some chipset-specific modes are shown "

"different BIOSes are often shipped with the same card and the mode numbers "
"depend purely on the VGA BIOS)."
msgstr ""

"The modes displayed on the menu are partially sorted: The list starts with "
"the standard modes (80x25 and 80x50) followed by \"special\" modes (80x28 "

"If you are not happy with the mode list offered (e.g., if you think your "
"card is able to do more), you can enter \"scan\" instead of item number / "
"mode ID.  The program will try to ask the BIOS for all possible video mode "
"numbers and test what happens then. The screen will be probably flashing "
"wildly for some time and strange noises will be heard from inside the "
"monitor and so on and then, really all consistent video modes supported by "
"your BIOS will appear (plus maybe some ``ghost modes``). If you are afraid "
"this could damage your monitor, don't use this function."

"If you add 0x8000 to the mode ID, the program will try to recalculate "

"VIDEO_GFX_HACK - includes special hack for setting of graphics modes to be "

"If you start Linux from M$-DOS, you might also use some DOS tools for video "
