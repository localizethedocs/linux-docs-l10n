"Unfortunately, automatic enabling of laptop mode does not work for laptops "

"The downside of laptop mode is that you have a chance of losing up to 10 "

"Laptop mode is controlled by the knob /proc/sys/vm/laptop_mode. This knob is "
"present for all kernels that have the laptop mode patch, regardless of any "
"configuration options. When the knob is set, any physical disk I/O (that "
"might have caused the hard disk to spin up) causes Linux to flush all dirty "
"blocks. The result of this is that after a disk has spun down, it will not "
"be spun up anymore to write dirty blocks, because those blocks had already "
"been written immediately after the most recent read operation. The value of "
"the laptop_mode knob determines the time between the occurrence of disk I/O "
"and when the flush is triggered. A sensible value for the knob is 5 seconds. "
"Setting the knob to 0 disables laptop mode."

"To increase the effectiveness of the laptop_mode strategy, the laptop_mode "
"control script increases dirty_expire_centisecs and "
"dirty_writeback_centisecs in /proc/sys/vm to about 10 minutes (by default), "
"which means that pages that are dirtied are not forced to be written to disk "
"as often. The control script also changes the dirty background ratio, so "
"that background writeback of dirty pages is not done anymore. Combined with "
"a higher commit value (also 10 minutes) for ext3 or ReiserFS filesystems "
"(also done automatically by the control script), this results in "
"concentration of disk activity in a small time interval which occurs only "
"once every 10 minutes, or whenever the disk is forced to spin up by a cache "
"miss. The disk can then be spun down in the periods of inactivity."
