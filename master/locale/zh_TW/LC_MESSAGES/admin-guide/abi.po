"This part of the documentation inside Documentation/ABI directory attempts "
"to document the ABI between the Linux kernel and userspace, and the relative "
"stability of these interfaces.  Due to the everchanging nature of Linux, and "
"the differing maturity levels, these interfaces should be used by userspace "
"programs in different ways."

"Userspace programs can start to rely on these interfaces, but they must be "
"aware of changes that can occur before these interfaces move to be marked "
"stable.  Programs that use these interfaces are strongly encouraged to add "
