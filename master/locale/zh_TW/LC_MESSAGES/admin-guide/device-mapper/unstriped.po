"The device-mapper \"unstriped\" target provides a transparent mechanism to "
"unstripe a device-mapper \"striped\" target to access the underlying disks "
"without having to touch the true backing block-device.  It can also be used "

"Intel NVMe drives contain two cores on the physical device. Each core of the "

"The purpose of this unstriping is to provide better QoS in noisy neighbor "
"environments. When two partitions are created on the aggregate drive without "
"this unstriping, reads on one partition can affect writes on another "
"partition.  This is because the partitions are striped across the two "
"cores.  When we unstripe this hardware RAID 0 and make partitions on each "
"new exposed device the two partitions are now physically separated."

"reduction in read latency using this device mapper target."
