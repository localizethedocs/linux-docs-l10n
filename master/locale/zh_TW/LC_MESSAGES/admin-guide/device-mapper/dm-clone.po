"dm-clone is a device mapper target which produces a one-to-one copy of an "
"existing, read-only source device into a writable destination device: It "
"presents a virtual block device which makes all data appear immediately, and "
"redirects reads and writes accordingly."

"The main use case of dm-clone is to clone a potentially remote, high-"
"latency, read-only, archival-type block device into a writable, fast, "
"primary-type device for fast, low-latency I/O. The cloned device is visible/"
"mountable immediately and the copy of the source device to the destination "
"device happens in the background, in parallel with user I/O."

"For example, one could restore an application backup from a read-only copy, "
