"Linux now has some ability to manipulate cursor appearance.  Normally, you "
"can set the size of hardware cursor.  You can now play a few new tricks: you "
"can make your cursor look like a non-blinking red block, make it inverse "
"background of the character it's over or to highlight that character and "
"still choose whether the original hardware cursor should remain visible or "
"not.  There may be other things I have never thought of."

"selects character attribute bits you want to change (by simply XORing them "
