"In order to create the pull request you must first tag the branch that you "
"have just created. It is recommended that you choose a meaningful tag name, "
"in a way that you and others can understand, even after some time.  A good "
"practice is to include in the name an indicator of the subsystem of origin "
"and the target kernel version."

"Greg offers the following. A pull request with miscellaneous stuff for "
"drivers/char, to be applied at the Kernel version 4.15-rc1 could be named as "
"``char-misc-4.15-rc1``. If such tag would be produced from a branch named "
"``char-misc-next``, you would be using the following command::"

"that will create a signed tag called ``char-misc-4.15-rc1`` based on the "

"When you run the above command ``git`` will drop you into an editor and ask "
"you to describe the tag.  In this case, you are describing a pull request, "
"so outline what is contained here, why it should be merged, and what, if "
"any, testing has been done.  All of this information will end up in the tag "
"itself, and then in the merge commit that the maintainer makes if/when they "
"merge the pull request. So write it up well, as it will be in the kernel "
