"A Compute Express Link Memory Device is a CXL component that implements the "
"CXL.mem protocol. It contains some amount of volatile memory, persistent "
"memory, or both. It is enumerated as a PCI device for configuration and "
"passing messages over an MMIO mailbox. Its contribution to the System "
"Physical Address space is handled via HDM (Host Managed Device Memory) "

"Similar to how a RAID driver takes disk objects and assembles them into a "
"new logical device, the CXL subsystem is tasked to take PCIe and ACPI "
"objects and assemble them into a CXL.mem decode topology. The need for "
"runtime configuration of the CXL.mem topology is also similar to RAID in "
"that different environments with the same hardware configuration may decide "
"to assemble the topology in contrasting ways. One may choose performance "
"(RAID0) striping memory across multiple Host Bridges and endpoints while "
"another may opt for fault tolerance and disable any striping in the CXL.mem "

"Platform firmware enumerates a menu of interleave options at the \"CXL root "
"port\" (Linux term for the top of the CXL decode topology). From there, PCIe "
"topology dictates which endpoints can participate in which Host Bridge "
"decode regimes. Each PCIe Switch in the path between the root and an "
"endpoint introduces a point at which the interleave can be split. For "
"example, platform firmware may say a given range only decodes to one Host "
"Bridge, but that Host Bridge may in turn interleave cycles across multiple "
"Root Ports. An intervening Switch between a port and an endpoint may "
"interleave cycles across multiple Downstream Switch Ports, etc."

"Continuing the RAID analogy, disks have both topology metadata and on-device "

"PCIe core attaches the cxl_pci driver to a CXL Memory Expander there is no "
"role for CXL Port objects. Conversely for hot-unplug / removal scenarios, "
