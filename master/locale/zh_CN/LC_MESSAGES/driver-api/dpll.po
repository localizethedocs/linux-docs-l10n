"For SyncE enablement it is required to allow control over dpll device for a "
"software application which monitors and configures the inputs of dpll device "
"in response to current state of a dpll device and its inputs. In such "
"scenario, dpll device input signal shall be also configurable to drive dpll "
"with signal recovered from the PHY netdevice. This is done by exposing a pin "
"to the netdevice - attaching pin to the netdevice itself with "
"``dpll_netdev_pin_set(struct net_device *dev, struct dpll_pin *dpll_pin)``. "
"Exposed pin id handle ``DPLL_A_PIN_ID`` is then identifiable by the user as "
"it is attached to rtnetlink respond to get ``RTM_NEWLINK`` command in nested "
"attribute ``IFLA_DPLL_PIN``."
