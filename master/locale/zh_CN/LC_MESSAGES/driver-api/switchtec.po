"Microsemi's \"Switchtec\" line of PCI switch devices is already supported by "
"the kernel with standard PCI switch drivers. However, the Switchtec device "
"advertises a special management endpoint which enables some additional "

"The primary means of communicating with the Switchtec management firmware is "
"through the Memory-mapped Remote Procedure Call (MRPC) interface. Commands "
"are submitted to the interface with a 4-byte command identifier and up to "
"1KB of command specific data. The firmware will respond with a 4-byte return "
"code and up to 1KB of command-specific data. The interface only processes a "
"single command at a time."

"A write must consist of at least 4 bytes and no more than 1028 bytes. The "

"begin processing."

"SWITCHTEC_IOCTL_EVENT_CTL - Get the current count, clear and set flags for "

"event_id, index and flags set (index being the partition or PFF number for "
"non-global events). It returns whether the event has occurred, the number of "
"times and any event specific data. The flags can be used to clear the count "
"or enable and disable actions to happen when the event occurs. By using the "
"SWITCHTEC_IOCTL_EVENT_FLAG_EN_POLL flag, you can set an event to trigger a "
"poll command to return with POLLPRI. In this way, userspace can wait for "
"events to occur."
