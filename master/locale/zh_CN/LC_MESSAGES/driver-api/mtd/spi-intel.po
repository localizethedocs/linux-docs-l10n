"Many Intel CPUs like Baytrail and Braswell include SPI serial flash host "
"controller which is used to hold BIOS and other platform specific data. "
"Since contents of the SPI serial flash is crucial for machine to function, "
"it is typically protected by different hardware protection mechanisms to "
"avoid accidental (or on purpose) overwrite of the content."

"Not all manufacturers protect the SPI serial flash, mainly because it allows "

"The spi-intel driver makes it possible to read and write the SPI serial "
"flash, if certain protection bits are not set and locked. If it finds any of "
"them set, the whole MTD device is made read-only to prevent partial "
"overwrites. By default the driver exposes SPI serial flash contents as read-"
"only but it can be changed from kernel command line, passing \"spi_intel."
"writeable=1\"."
