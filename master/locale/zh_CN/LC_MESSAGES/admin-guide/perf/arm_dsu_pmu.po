"ARM DynamIQ Shared Unit integrates one or more cores with an L3 memory "
"system, control logic and external interfaces to form a multicore cluster. "
"The PMU allows counting the various events related to the L3 cache, Snoop "
"Control Unit etc, using 32bit independent counters. It also provides a 64bit "
"cycle counter."

"The PMU can only be accessed via CPU system registers and are common to the "
"cores connected to the same DSU. Like most of the other uncore PMUs, DSU PMU "
"doesn't support process specific events and cannot be used in sampling mode."

"The DSU provides a bitmap for a subset of implemented events via hardware "
"registers. There is no way for the driver to determine if the other events "
"are available or not. Hence the driver exposes only those events advertised "
"by the DSU, in \"events\" directory under::"

"The user should refer to the TRM of the product to figure out the supported "
"events and use the raw event code for the unlisted events."
