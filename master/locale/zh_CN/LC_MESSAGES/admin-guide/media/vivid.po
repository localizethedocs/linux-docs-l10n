"The EDID that each output reads reports a unique CEC physical address that "
"is based on the physical address of the EDID of the input. So if the EDID of "
"the receiver has physical address A.B.0.0, then each output will see an EDID "
"containing physical address A.B.C.0 where C is 1 to the number of inputs. If "
"there are more outputs than inputs then the remaining outputs have a CEC "
"adapter that is disabled and reports an invalid physical address."
