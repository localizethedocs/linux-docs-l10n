"The device-mapper uevent code adds the capability to device-mapper to create "
"and send kobject uevents (uevents).  Previously device-mapper events were "
"only available through the ioctl interface.  The advantage of the uevents "
"interface is the event contains environment attributes providing increased "
"context for the event avoiding the need to query the state of the device-"
"mapper device after the event is received."
