"NFSv4 requires clients to identify themselves to servers with a unique "
"string.  File open and lock state shared between one client and one server "
"is associated with this identity.  To support robust NFSv4 state recovery "
"and transparent state migration, this identity string must not change across "
"client reboots."

"Without any other intervention, the Linux client uses a string that contains "
"the local system's node name.  System administrators, however, often do not "
"take care to ensure that node names are fully qualified and do not change "
"over the lifetime of a client system.  Node names can have other "
"administrative requirements that require particular behavior that does not "
"work well as part of an nfs_client_id4 string."

"The nfs.nfs4_unique_id boot parameter specifies a unique string that can be "
"used together with  a system's node name when an NFS client identifies "

"The nfs.nfs4_unique_id string is typically a UUID, though it can contain "
"anything that is believed to be unique across all NFS clients.  An "
"nfs4_unique_id string should be chosen when a client system is installed, "
"just as a system's root file system gets a fresh UUID in its label at "
"install time."

"The fs_locations information can take the form of either an ip address and a "

"upcall to allow userland to provide this service."
