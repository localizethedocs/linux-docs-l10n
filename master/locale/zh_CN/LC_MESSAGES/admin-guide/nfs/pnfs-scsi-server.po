"This document describes support for pNFS SCSI layouts in the Linux NFS "
"server. With pNFS SCSI layouts, the NFS server acts as Metadata Server (MDS) "
"for pNFS, which in addition to handling all the metadata access to the NFS "
"export, also hands out layouts to the clients so that they can directly "
"access the underlying SCSI LUNs that are shared with the client."

"To use pNFS SCSI layouts with the Linux NFS server, the exported file system "
"needs to support the pNFS SCSI layouts (currently just XFS), and the file "
"system must sit on a SCSI LUN that is accessible to the clients in addition "
"to the MDS.  As of now the file system needs to sit directly on the exported "
"LUN, striping or concatenation of LUNs on the MDS and clients is not "
"supported yet."

"On a server built with CONFIG_NFSD_SCSI, the pNFS SCSI volume support is "
"automatically enabled if the file system is exported using the \"pnfs\" "
"option and the underlying SCSI device support persistent reservations. On "
"the client make sure the kernel has the CONFIG_PNFS_BLOCK option enabled, "
"and the file system is mounted using the NFSv4.1 protocol version (mount -o "
"vers=4.1)."
