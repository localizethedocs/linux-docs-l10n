msgid ""
"Integrity Policy Enforcement (IPE) is a Linux Security Module that takes a "
"complementary approach to access control. Unlike traditional access control "
"mechanisms that rely on labels and paths for decision-making, IPE focuses on "
"the immutable security properties inherent to system components. These "
"properties are fundamental attributes or features of a system component that "
"cannot be altered, ensuring a consistent and reliable basis for security "
"decisions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/LSM/ipe.rst:23
msgid ""
"To elaborate, in the context of IPE, system components primarily refer to "
"files or the devices these files reside on. However, this is just a starting "
"point. The concept of system components is flexible and can be extended to "
"include new elements as the system evolves. The immutable properties include "
"the origin of a file, which remains constant and unchangeable over time. For "
"example, IPE policies can be crafted to trust files originating from the "
"initramfs. Since initramfs is typically verified by the bootloader, its "
"files are deemed trustworthy; \"file is from initramfs\" becomes an "
"immutable property under IPE's consideration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/LSM/ipe.rst:33
msgid ""
"The immutable property concept extends to the security features enabled on a "
"file's origin, such as dm-verity or fs-verity, which provide a layer of "
"integrity and trust. For example, IPE allows the definition of policies that "
"trust files from a dm-verity protected device. dm-verity ensures the "
"integrity of an entire device by providing a verifiable and immutable state "
"of its contents. Similarly, fs-verity offers filesystem-level integrity "
"checks, allowing IPE to enforce policies that trust files protected by fs-"
"verity. These two features cannot be turned off once established, so they "
"are considered immutable properties. These examples demonstrate how IPE "
"leverages immutable properties, such as a file's origin and its integrity "
"protection mechanisms, to make access control decisions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/LSM/ipe.rst:45
msgid ""
"For the IPE policy, specifically, it grants the ability to enforce stringent "
"access controls by assessing security properties against reference values "
"defined within the policy. This assessment can be based on the existence of "
"a security property (e.g., verifying if a file originates from initramfs) or "
"evaluating the internal state of an immutable security property. The latter "
"includes checking the roothash of a dm-verity protected device, determining "
"whether dm-verity possesses a valid signature, assessing the digest of a fs-"
"verity protected file, or determining whether fs-verity possesses a valid "
"built-in signature. This nuanced approach to policy enforcement enables a "
"highly secure and customizable system defense mechanism, tailored to "
"specific security requirements and trust models."

msgid ""
"IPE works best in fixed-function devices: devices in which their purpose is "
"clearly defined and not supposed to be changed (e.g. network firewall device "
"in a data center, an IoT device, etcetera), where all software and "
"configuration is built and provisioned by the system owner."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/LSM/ipe.rst:70
msgid ""
"IPE is a long-way off for use in general-purpose computing: the Linux "
"community as a whole tends to follow a decentralized trust model (known as "
"the web of trust), which IPE has no support for it yet. Instead, IPE "
"supports PKI (public key infrastructure), which generally designates a set "
"of trusted entities that provide a measure of absolute trust."
msgstr ""

"Additionally, while most packages are signed today, the files inside the "
"packages (for instance, the executables), tend to be unsigned. This makes it "
"difficult to utilize IPE in systems where a package manager is expected to "
"be functional, without major changes to the package manager and ecosystem "
"behind it."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/LSM/ipe.rst:88
msgid ""
"IPE cannot verify the integrity of anonymous executable memory, such as the "
"trampolines created by gcc closures and libffi (<3.4.2), or JIT'd code. "
"Unfortunately, as this is dynamically generated code, there is no way for "
"IPE to ensure the integrity of this code to form a trust basis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/LSM/ipe.rst:93
msgid ""
"IPE cannot verify the integrity of programs written in interpreted languages "
"when these scripts are invoked by passing these program files to the "
"interpreter. This is because the way interpreters execute these files; the "
"scripts themselves are not evaluated as executable code through one of IPE's "
"hooks, but they are merely text files that are read (as opposed to compiled "
"executables). However, with the introduction of the ``AT_EXECVE_CHECK`` flag "
"(:doc:`AT_EXECVE_CHECK </userspace-api/check_exec>`), interpreters can use "
"it to signal the kernel that a script file will be executed, and request the "
"kernel to perform LSM security checks on it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/LSM/ipe.rst:103
msgid ""
"IPE's EXECUTE operation enforcement differs between compiled executables and "
"interpreted scripts: For compiled executables, enforcement is triggered "
"automatically by the kernel during ``execve()``, ``execveat()``, ``mmap()`` "
"and ``mprotect()`` syscalls when loading executable content. For interpreted "
"scripts, enforcement requires explicit interpreter integration using "
"``execveat()`` with ``AT_EXECVE_CHECK`` flag. Unlike exec syscalls that IPE "
"intercepts during the execution process, this mechanism needs the "
"interpreter to take the initiative, and existing interpreters won't be "
"automatically supported unless the signal call is added."

"To illustrate, consider a scenario where an untrusted binary, possibly "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/LSM/ipe.rst:125

"IPE achieves this by verifying the integrity and authenticity of all "
"executable code before allowing them to run. It conducts a thorough check to "
"ensure that the code's integrity is intact and that they match an authorized "
"reference value (digest, signature, etc) as per the defined policy. If a "
"binary does not pass this verification process, either because its integrity "
"has been compromised or it does not meet the authorization criteria, IPE "
"will deny its execution. Additionally, IPE generates audit logs which may be "
"utilized to detect and analyze failures resulting from policy violation."
