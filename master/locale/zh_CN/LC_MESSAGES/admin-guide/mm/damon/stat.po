"Data Access Monitoring Results Stat (DAMON_STAT) is a static kernel module "
"that is aimed to be used for simple access pattern monitoring.  It monitors "
"accesses on the system's entire physical memory using DAMON, and provides "
"simplified access monitoring results statistics, namely idle time "
"percentiles and estimated memory bandwidth."

"DAMON_STAT uses monitoring intervals :ref:`auto-tuning "
"<damon_design_monitoring_intervals_autotuning>` to make its accuracy high "
"and overhead minimum.  It auto-tunes the intervals aiming 4 % of observable "
"access events to be captured in each snapshot, while limiting the resulting "
"sampling events to be 5 milliseconds in minimum and 10 seconds in maximum.  "
"On a few production server systems, it resulted in consuming only 0.x % "
"single CPU time, while capturing reasonable quality of access patterns."

"To use this feature, you should first ensure your system is running on a "
"kernel that is built with ``CONFIG_DAMON_STAT=y``.  The feature can be "
"enabled by default at build time, by setting "
"``CONFIG_DAMON_STAT_ENABLED_DEFAULT`` true."

"To let sysadmins enable or disable it at boot and/or runtime, and read the "

"DAMON_STAT reads observed access events on the current DAMON results "
"snapshot and converts it to memory bandwidth consumption estimation in bytes "
"per second. The resulting metric is exposed to user via this read-only "
"parameter.  Because DAMON uses sampling, this is only an estimation of the "
"access intensity rather than accurate memory bandwidth."

"DAMON_STAT calculates how long each byte of the memory was not accessed "
"until now (idle time), based on the current DAMON results snapshot.  If "
"DAMON found a region of access frequency (nr_accesses) larger than zero, "
"every byte of the region gets zero idle time.  If a region has zero access "
"frequency (nr_accesses), how long the region was keeping the zero access "
"frequency (age) becomes the idle time of every byte of the region.  Then, "
"DAMON_STAT exposes the percentiles of the idle time values via this read-"
"only parameter.  Reading the parameter returns 101 idle time values in "
"milliseconds, separated by comma. Each value represents 0-th, 1st, 2nd, "
"3rd, ..., 99th and 100th percentile idle times."
