"The CoreSight Cross Trigger Interface (CTI) is a hardware device that takes "
"individual input and output hardware signals known as triggers to and from "
"devices and interconnects them via the Cross Trigger Matrix (CTM) to other "
"devices via numbered channels, in order to propagate events between devices."

"The CTI driver enables the programming of the CTI to attach triggers to "
"channels. When an input trigger becomes active, the attached channel will "
"become active. Any output trigger attached to that channel will also become "
"active. The active channel is propagated to other CTIs via the CTM, "
"activating connected output triggers there, unless filtered by the CTI "
"channel gate."

"The CTIs are registered by the system to be associated with CPUs and/or "
