"AC97 and HD-audio drivers have the automatic power-saving mode. This feature "
"is enabled via Kconfig ``CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE`` and "
"``CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE`` options, respectively."

"With the automatic power-saving, the driver turns off the codec power "
"appropriately when no operation is required.  When no applications use the "
"device and/or no analog loopback is set, the power disablement is done fully "
"or partially.  It'll save a certain power consumption, thus good for laptops "
"(even for desktops)."

"The time-out for automatic power-off can be specified via ``power_save`` "
"module option of snd-ac97-codec and snd-hda-intel modules.  Specify the time-"
"out value in seconds.  0 means to disable the automatic power-saving.  The "
"default value of timeout is given via ``CONFIG_SND_AC97_POWER_SAVE_DEFAULT`` "
"and ``CONFIG_SND_HDA_POWER_SAVE_DEFAULT`` Kconfig options.  Setting this to "
"1 (the minimum value) isn't recommended because many applications try to "
"reopen the device frequently.  10 would be a good choice for normal "
"operations."

"The ``power_save`` option is exported as writable.  This means you can "
"adjust the value via sysfs on the fly.  For example, to turn on the "
"automatic power-save mode with 10 seconds, write to ``/sys/module/"
"snd_ac97_codec/parameters/power_save`` (usually as root): ::"

"Note that you might hear click noise/pop when changing the power state.  "
"Also, it often takes certain time to wake up from the power-down to the "
"active state.  These are often hard to fix, so don't report extra bug "
"reports unless you have a fix patch ;-)"

"For HD-audio interface, there is another module option, "
"power_save_controller.  This enables/disables the power-save mode of the "
"controller side.  Setting this on may reduce a bit more power consumption, "
"but might result in longer wake-up time and click noise. Try to turn it off "
"when you experience such a thing too often."
