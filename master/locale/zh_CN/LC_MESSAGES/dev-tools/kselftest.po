"The kernel contains a set of \"self tests\" under the tools/testing/"

"Kselftest from mainline can be run on older stable kernels. Running tests "
"from mainline offers the best coverage. Several test rings run mainline "
"kselftest suite on stable releases. The reason is that when a new test gets "
"added to test existing code to regression test a bug, we should be able to "
"run that test on an older kernel. Hence, it is important to keep code that "
"can still test an older kernel and make sure it skips the test gracefully on "
"newer releases."
