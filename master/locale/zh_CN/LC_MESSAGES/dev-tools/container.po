"The ``container`` tool can be used to run any command in the kernel source "
"tree from within a container.  Doing so facilitates reproducing builds "
"across various platforms, for example when a test bot has reported an issue "
"which requires a specific version of a compiler or an external test suite.  "
"While this can already be done by users who are familiar with containers, "
"having a dedicated tool in the kernel tree lowers the barrier to entry by "
"solving common problems once and for all (e.g. user id management).  It also "
"makes it easier to share an exact command line leading to a particular "
"result.  The main use case is likely to be kernel builds but virtually "
"anything can be run: KUnit, checkpatch etc. provided a suitable image is "
"available."

msgid ""
"It's entirely up to the user to choose which image to use and the ``CMD`` "

"current working directory and adjust the user and group id as needed."

"The container image which would typically include a compiler toolchain is "
"provided by the user and selected via the ``-i`` option.  The container "
"runtime can be selected with the ``-r`` option, which can be either "
"``docker`` or ``podman``.  If none is specified, the first one found on the "
"system will be used while giving priority to Podman.  Support for other "
"runtimes may be added later depending on their popularity among users."

"By default, commands are run non-interactively.  The user can abort a "

"a TTY, the ``--shell`` or ``-s`` option can be used.  Signals will then be "
"received by the shell directly rather than the parent ``container`` "
"process.  To exit an interactive shell, use Ctrl-D or ``exit``."

"This is an area where the behaviour will vary slightly depending on the "
"container runtime.  The goal is to run commands as the user invoking the "
"tool. With Podman, a namespace is created to map the current user id to a "
"different one in the container (1000 by default).  With Docker, while this "
"is also possible with recent versions it requires a special feature to be "
"enabled in the daemon so it's not used here for simplicity.  Instead, the "
"container is run with the current user id directly.  In both cases, this "
"will provide the same file permissions for the kernel source tree mounted as "
"a volume.  The only difference is that when using Docker without a "
"namespace, the user id may not be the same as the default one set in the "
"image."

"Say, we're using an image which sets up a default user with id 1000 and the "
"current user calling the ``container`` tool has id 1234.  The kernel source "
"tree was checked out by this same user so the files belong to user 1234.  "
"With Podman, the container will be running as user id 1000 with a mapping to "
"id 1234 so that the files from the mounted volume appear to belong to id "
"1000 inside the container.  With Docker and no namespace, the container will "
"be running with user id 1234 which can access the files in the volume but "
"not in the user 1000 home directory.  This shouldn't be an issue when "
"running commands only in the kernel tree but it is worth highlighting here "
"as it might matter for special corner cases."
