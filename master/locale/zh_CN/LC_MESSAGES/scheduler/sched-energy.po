"Energy Aware Scheduling (or EAS) gives the scheduler the ability to predict "
"the impact of its decisions on the energy consumed by CPUs. EAS relies on an "
"Energy Model (EM) of the CPUs to select an energy efficient CPU for each "
"task, with a minimal impact on throughput. This document aims at providing "
"an introduction on how EAS works, what are the main design decisions behind "
"it, and details what is needed to get it to run."

"the highest."

"The idea behind introducing an EM is to allow the scheduler to evaluate the "
"implications of its decisions rather than blindly applying energy-saving "
"techniques that may have positive effects only on some platforms. At the "
"same time, the EM must be as simple as possible to minimize the scheduler "
"latency impact."

"In short, EAS changes the way CFS tasks are assigned to CPUs. When it is "
"time for the scheduler to decide where a task should run (during wake-up), "
"the EM is used to break the tie between several good CPU candidates and pick "
"the one that is predicted to yield the best energy consumption without "
"harming the system's throughput. The predictions made by EAS rely on "
"specific elements of knowledge about the platform's topology, which include "
"the 'capacity' of CPUs, and their respective energy costs."

"EAS (as well as the rest of the scheduler) uses the notion of 'capacity' to "
"differentiate CPUs with different computing throughput. The 'capacity' of a "
"CPU represents the amount of work it can absorb when running at its highest "
"frequency compared to the most capable CPU of the system. Capacity values "
"are normalized in a 1024 range, and are comparable with the utilization "
"signals of tasks and CPUs computed by the Per-Entity Load Tracking (PELT) "
"mechanism. Thanks to capacity and utilization values, EAS is able to "
"estimate how big/busy a task/CPU is, and to take this into consideration "
"when evaluating performance vs energy trade-offs. The capacity of CPUs is "
"provided via arch-specific code through the arch_scale_cpu_capacity() "
"callback."

"EAS overrides the CFS task wake-up balancing code. It uses the EM of the "

"find_energy_efficient_cpu() to do the placement decision. This function "
"looks for the CPU with the highest spare capacity (CPU capacity - CPU "
"utilization) in each performance domain since it is the one which will allow "

"Big CPUs are generally more power hungry than the little ones and are thus "

"the high OPPs of the little CPUs can be less energy-efficient than the "
"lowest OPPs of the bigs, for example. So, if the little CPUs happen to have "
"enough utilization at a specific point in time, a small task waking up at "
"that moment could be better off executing on the big side in order to save "
"energy, even though it would fit on the little side."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scheduler/sched-energy.rst:258
msgid ""
"And even in the case where all OPPs of the big CPUs are less energy-"
"efficient than those of the little, using the big CPUs for a small task "
"might still, under specific conditions, save energy. Indeed, placing a task "
"on a little CPU can result in raising the OPP of the entire performance "
"domain, and that will increase the cost of the tasks already running there. "
"If the waking task is placed on a big CPU, its own execution cost might be "
"higher than if it was running on a little, but it won't impact the other "
"tasks of the little CPUs which will keep running at a lower OPP. So, when "
"considering the total energy consumed by CPUs, the extra cost of running "
"that one task on a big core can be smaller than the cost of raising the OPP "
"on the little CPUs for all the other tasks."

"The examples above would be nearly impossible to get right in a generic way, "

"with them correctly without too many troubles. However, in order to ensure a "
"minimal impact on throughput for high-utilization scenarios, EAS also "
"implements another mechanism called 'over-utilization'."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../scheduler/sched-energy.rst:281
msgid ""
"From a general standpoint, the use-cases where EAS can help the most are "
"those involving a light/medium CPU utilization. Whenever long CPU-bound "
"tasks are being run, they will require all of the available CPU capacity, "
"and there isn't much that can be done by the scheduler to save energy "
"without severely harming throughput. In order to avoid hurting performance "
"with EAS, CPUs are flagged as 'over-utilized' as soon as they are used at "
"more than 80% of their compute capacity. As long as no CPUs are over-"
"utilized in a root domain, load balancing is disabled and EAS overrides the "
"wake-up balancing code. EAS is likely to load the most energy efficient CPUs "
"of the system more than the others if that can be done without harming "
"throughput. So, the load-balancer is disabled to prevent it from breaking "
"the energy-efficient task placement found by EAS. It is safe to do so when "
"the system isn't overutilized since being below the 80% tipping point "
"implies that:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scheduler/sched-energy.rst:295

"there is some idle time on all CPUs, so the utilization signals used by EAS "
"are likely to accurately represent the 'size' of the various tasks in the "

msgid ""
"all tasks should already be provided with enough CPU capacity, regardless of "
"their nice values;"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"since there is spare capacity all tasks must be blocking/sleeping regularly "
"and balancing at wake-up is sufficient."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scheduler/sched-energy.rst:303
msgid ""
"As soon as one CPU goes above the 80% tipping point, at least one of the "
"three assumptions above becomes incorrect. In this scenario, the "
"'overutilized' flag is raised for the entire root domain, EAS is disabled, "
"and the load-balancer is re-enabled. By doing so, the scheduler falls back "
"onto load-based algorithms for wake-up and load balance under CPU-bound "
"conditions. This provides a better respect of the nice values of tasks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scheduler/sched-energy.rst:310
msgid ""
"Since the notion of overutilization largely relies on detecting whether or "
"not there is some idle time in the system, the CPU capacity 'stolen' by "
"higher (than CFS) scheduling classes (as well as IRQ) must be taken into "
"account. As such, the detection of overutilization accounts for the capacity "
