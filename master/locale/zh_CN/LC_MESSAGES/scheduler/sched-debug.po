"`numa_balancing` directory is used to hold files to control NUMA balancing "
"feature.  If the system overhead from the feature is too high then the rate "
"the kernel samples for NUMA hinting faults may be controlled by the "
"`scan_period_min_ms, scan_delay_ms, scan_period_max_ms, scan_size_mb` files."

"Automatic NUMA balancing scans tasks address space and unmaps pages to "
"detect if pages are properly placed or if the data should be migrated to a "
"memory node local to where the task is running.  Every \"scan delay\" the "
"task scans the next \"scan size\" number of pages in its address space. When "
"the end of the address space is reached the scanner restarts from the "
"beginning."

#: ../../../scheduler/sched-debug.rst:28
msgid ""
"In combination, the \"scan delay\" and \"scan size\" determine the scan "
"rate. When \"scan delay\" decreases, the scan rate increases.  The scan "
"delay and hence the scan rate of every task is adaptive and depends on "
"historical behaviour. If pages are properly placed then the scan delay "
"increases, otherwise the scan delay decreases.  The \"scan size\" is not "
"adaptive but the higher the \"scan size\", the higher the scan rate."

#: ../../../scheduler/sched-debug.rst:35
msgid ""
"Higher scan rates incur higher system overhead as page faults must be "
"trapped and potentially data must be migrated. However, the higher the scan "
"rate, the more quickly a tasks memory is migrated to a local node if the "
"workload pattern changes and minimises performance impact due to remote "
"memory accesses. These files control the thresholds for scan delays and the "
"number of pages scanned."
