msgid ""
"The Qualcomm LPG can be found in a variety of Qualcomm PMICs and consists of "
"a number of PWM channels, a programmable pattern lookup table and a RGB LED "
"current sink."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../leds/leds-qcom-lpg.rst:14
msgid ""
"To facilitate the various use cases, the LPG channels can be exposed as "
"individual LEDs, grouped together as RGB LEDs or otherwise be accessed as "
"PWM channels. The output of each PWM channel is routed to other hardware "
"blocks, such as the RGB current sink, GPIO pins etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../leds/leds-qcom-lpg.rst:19
msgid ""
"The each PWM channel can operate with a period between 27us and 384 seconds "
"and has a 9 bit resolution of the duty cycle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../leds/leds-qcom-lpg.rst:22
msgid ""
"In order to provide support for status notifications with the CPU subsystem "
"in deeper idle states the LPG provides pattern support. This consists of a "
"shared lookup table of brightness values and per channel properties to "
"select the range within the table to use, the rate and if the pattern should "
"repeat."

"The pattern for a channel can be programmed using the \"pattern\" trigger, "
"using the hw_pattern attribute."

"The pattern is a series of brightness and hold-time pairs, with the hold-"
"time expressed in milliseconds. The hold time is a property of the pattern "
"and must therefore be identical for each element in the pattern (except for "
"the pauses described below). As the LPG hardware is not able to perform the "
"linear transitions expected by the leds-trigger-pattern format, each entry "
"in the pattern must be followed a zero-length entry of the same brightness."

"The LPG supports specifying a longer hold-time for the first and last "
"element in the pattern, the so called \"low pause\" and \"high pause\"."

"Similarly, the last entry can be stretched by using a higher hold-time on "
"the last entry."

msgid ""
"In order to save space in the shared lookup table the LPG supports \"ping-"
"pong\" mode, in which case each run through the pattern is performed by "
"first running the pattern forward, then backwards. This mode is "
"automatically used by the driver when the given pattern is a palindrome. In "
"this case the \"high pause\" denotes the wait time before the pattern is run "
"in reverse and as such the specified hold-time of the middle item in the "
"pattern is allowed to have a different hold-time."
