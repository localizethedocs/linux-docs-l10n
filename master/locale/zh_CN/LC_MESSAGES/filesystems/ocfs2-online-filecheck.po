"OCFS2 is often used in high-availability systems. However, OCFS2 usually "
"converts the filesystem to read-only when encounters an error. This may not "
"be necessary, since turning the filesystem read-only would affect other "
"running processes as well, decreasing availability. Then, a mount option "
"(errors=continue) is introduced, which would return the -EIO errno to the "
"calling process and terminate further processing so that the filesystem is "
"not corrupted further. The filesystem is not converted to read-only, and the "
"problematic file's inode number is reported in the kernel log. The user can "
"try to check/fix this file via online filecheck feature."

"This effort is to check/fix small issues which may hinder day-to-day "
"operations of a cluster filesystem by turning the filesystem read-only. The "
"scope of checking/fixing is at the file level, initially for regular files "
"and eventually to all files (including system files) of the filesystem."

"This feature is not suited for extravagant checks which involve dependency "
