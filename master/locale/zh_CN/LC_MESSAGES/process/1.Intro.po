"The rest of this section covers the scope of the kernel development process "
"and the kinds of frustrations that developers and their employers can "
"encounter there.  There are a great many reasons why kernel code should be "
"merged into the official (\"mainline\") kernel, including automatic "
"availability to users, community support in many forms, and the ability to "
"influence the direction of kernel development.  Code contributed to the "
"Linux kernel must be made available under a GPL-compatible license."

"The Linux kernel, at over 8 million lines of code and well over 1000 "
"contributors to each release, is one of the largest and most active free "
"software projects in existence.  Since its humble beginning in 1991, this "
"kernel has evolved into a best-of-breed operating system component which "
"runs on pocket-sized digital music players, desktop PCs, the largest "
"supercomputers in existence, and all types of systems in between.  It is a "
"robust, efficient, and scalable solution for almost any situation."

"With the growth of Linux has come an increase in the number of developers "
"(and companies) wishing to participate in its development.  Hardware vendors "
"want to ensure that Linux supports their products well, making those "
"products attractive to Linux users.  Embedded systems vendors, who use Linux "
"as a component in an integrated product, want Linux to be as capable and "
"well-suited to the task at hand as possible.  Distributors and other "
"software vendors who base their products on Linux have a clear interest in "
"the capabilities, performance, and reliability of the Linux kernel.  And end "
"users, too, will often wish to change Linux to make it better suit their "
"needs."

"One of the most compelling features of Linux is that it is accessible to "
"these developers; anybody with the requisite skills can improve Linux and "
"influence the direction of its development.  Proprietary products cannot "
"offer this kind of openness, which is a characteristic of the free software "
"process.  But, if anything, the kernel is even more open than most other "
"free software projects.  A typical three-month kernel development cycle can "
"involve over 1000 developers working for more than 100 different companies "
"(or for no company at all)."

"Working with the kernel development community is not especially hard.  But, "
"that notwithstanding, many potential contributors have experienced "
"difficulties when trying to do kernel work.  The kernel community has "
"evolved its own distinct ways of operating which allow it to function "
"smoothly (and produce a high-quality product) in an environment where "
"thousands of lines of code are being changed every day.  So it is not "
"surprising that Linux kernel development process differs greatly from "
"proprietary development methods."

"The kernel's development process may come across as strange and intimidating "
"to new developers, but there are good reasons and solid experience behind "
"it.  A developer who does not understand the kernel community's ways (or, "
"worse, who tries to flout or circumvent them) will have a frustrating "
"experience in store.  The development community, while being helpful to "
"those who are trying to learn, has little time for those who will not listen "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some companies and developers occasionally wonder why they should bother "
"learning how to work with the kernel community and get their code into the "
"mainline kernel (the \"mainline\" being the kernel maintained by Linus "
"Torvalds and used as a base by Linux distributors).  In the short term, "
"contributing code can look like an avoidable expense; it seems easier to "
"just keep the code separate and support users directly.  The truth of the "
"matter is that keeping code separate (\"out of tree\") is a false economy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As a way of illustrating the costs of out-of-tree code, here are a few "
"relevant aspects of the kernel development process; most of these will be "
"discussed in greater detail later in this document.  Consider:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:132
msgid ""
"Code which has been merged into the mainline kernel is available to all "
"Linux users.  It will automatically be present on all distributions which "
"enable it.  There is no need for driver disks, downloads, or the hassles of "
"supporting multiple versions of multiple distributions; it all just works, "
"for the developer and for the user.  Incorporation into the mainline solves "
"a large number of distribution and support problems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:139
msgid ""
"While kernel developers strive to maintain a stable interface to user space, "
"the internal kernel API is in constant flux.  The lack of a stable internal "
"interface is a deliberate design decision; it allows fundamental "
"improvements to be made at any time and results in higher-quality code. But "
"one result of that policy is that any out-of-tree code requires constant "
"upkeep if it is to work with new kernels.  Maintaining out-of-tree code "
"requires significant amounts of work just to keep that code working."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:148
msgid ""
"Code which is in the mainline, instead, does not require this work as the "
"result of a simple rule requiring any developer who makes an API change to "
"also fix any code that breaks as the result of that change.  So code which "
"has been merged into the mainline has significantly lower maintenance costs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:154
msgid ""
"Beyond that, code which is in the kernel will often be improved by other "
"developers.  Surprising results can come from empowering your user community "
"and customers to improve your product."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:158
msgid ""
"Kernel code is subjected to review, both before and after merging into the "
"mainline.  No matter how strong the original developer's skills are, this "
"review process invariably finds ways in which the code can be improved.  "
"Often review finds severe bugs and security problems.  This is especially "
"true for code which has been developed in a closed environment; such code "
"benefits strongly from review by outside developers.  Out-of-tree code is "
"lower-quality code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:166
msgid ""
"Participation in the development process is your way to influence the "
"direction of kernel development.  Users who complain from the sidelines are "
"heard, but active developers have a stronger voice - and the ability to "
"implement changes which make the kernel work better for their needs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:171
msgid ""
"When code is maintained separately, the possibility that a third party will "
"contribute a different implementation of a similar feature always exists.  "
"Should that happen, getting your code merged will become much harder - to "
"the point of impossibility.  Then you will be faced with the unpleasant "
"alternatives of either (1) maintaining a nonstandard feature out of tree "
"indefinitely, or (2) abandoning your code and migrating your users over to "
"the in-tree version."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:179
msgid ""
"Contribution of code is the fundamental action which makes the whole process "
"work.  By contributing your code you can add new functionality to the kernel "
"and provide capabilities and examples which are of use to other kernel "
"developers.  If you have developed code for Linux (or are thinking about "
"doing so), you clearly have an interest in the continued success of this "
"platform; contributing code is one of the best ways to help ensure that "
"success."

"All of the reasoning above applies to any out-of-tree kernel code, including "
"code which is distributed in proprietary, binary-only form. There are, "
"however, additional factors which should be taken into account before "
"considering any sort of binary-only kernel code distribution.  These include:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:193
msgid ""
"The legal issues around the distribution of proprietary kernel modules are "
"cloudy at best; quite a few kernel copyright holders believe that most "
"binary-only modules are derived products of the kernel and that, as a "
"result, their distribution is a violation of the GNU General Public License "
"(about which more will be said below).  Your author is not a lawyer, and "
"nothing in this document can possibly be considered to be legal advice.  The "
"true legal status of closed-source modules can only be determined by the "
"courts.  But the uncertainty which haunts those modules is there regardless."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:203
msgid ""
"Binary modules greatly increase the difficulty of debugging kernel problems, "
"to the point that most kernel developers will not even try.  So the "
"distribution of binary-only modules will make it harder for your users to "
"get support from the community."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:208
msgid ""
"Support is also harder for distributors of binary-only modules, who must "
"provide a version of the module for every distribution and every kernel "
"version they wish to support.  Dozens of builds of a single module can be "
"required to provide reasonably comprehensive coverage, and your users will "
"have to upgrade your module separately every time they upgrade their kernel."

msgid ""
"Everything that was said above about code review applies doubly to closed-"
"source code.  Since this code is not available at all, it cannot have been "
"reviewed by the community and will, beyond doubt, have serious problems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:220
msgid ""
"Makers of embedded systems, in particular, may be tempted to disregard much "
"of what has been said in this section in the belief that they are shipping a "
"self-contained product which uses a frozen kernel version and requires no "
"more development after its release.  This argument misses the value of "
"widespread code review and the value of allowing your users to add "
"capabilities to your product.  But these products, too, have a limited "
"commercial life, after which a new version must be released.  At that point, "
"vendors whose code is in the mainline and well maintained will be much "
"better positioned to get the new product ready for market quickly."

"Code is contributed to the Linux kernel under a number of licenses, but all "
"code must be compatible with version 2 of the GNU General Public License "
"(GPLv2), which is the license covering the kernel distribution as a whole. "
"In practice, that means that all code contributions are covered either by "
"GPLv2 (with, optionally, language allowing distribution under later versions "
"of the GPL) or the three-clause BSD license.  Any contributions which are "
"not covered by a compatible license will not be accepted into the kernel."

"Copyright assignments are not required (or requested) for code contributed "
"to the kernel.  All code merged into the mainline kernel retains its "
"original ownership; as a result, the kernel now has thousands of owners."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:246
msgid ""
"One implication of this ownership structure is that any attempt to change "
"the licensing of the kernel is doomed to almost certain failure.  There are "
"few practical scenarios where the agreement of all copyright holders could "
"be obtained (or their code removed from the kernel).  So, in particular, "
"there is no prospect of a migration to version 3 of the GPL in the "
"foreseeable future."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/1.Intro.rst:253
msgid ""
"It is imperative that all code contributed to the kernel be legitimately "
"free software.  For that reason, code from contributors without a known "
"identity or anonymous contributors will not be accepted. All contributors "
"are required to \"sign off\" on their code, stating that the code can be "
"distributed with the kernel under the GPL.  Code which has not been licensed "
"as free software by its owner, or which risks creating copyright-related "
"problems for the kernel (such as code which derives from reverse-engineering "
"efforts lacking proper safeguards) cannot be contributed."

"Questions about copyright-related issues are common on Linux development "
