"\"That still leaves the question of, what does a stable binding look like?  "
"Certainly a stable binding means that a newer kernel will not break on an "
"older device tree, but that doesn't mean the binding is frozen for all time. "
"Grant said there are ways to change bindings that don't result in breakage. "
"For instance, if a new property is added, then default to the previous "
"behaviour if it is missing. If a binding truly needs an incompatible change, "
"then change the compatible string at the same time.  The driver can bind "
"against both the old and the new. These guidelines aren't new, but they "
"desperately need to be documented.\""

"Bindings can be augmented, but the driver shouldn't break when given the old "
"binding. ie. add additional properties, but don't change the meaning of an "
"existing property. For drivers, default to the original behaviour when a "
