"The GSC-based firmware structure is used for GSC releases on all platforms "

"structures are the same, some of the entries are specific to GSC while "

"Default link speed of discrete GPUs is determined by configuration "

"downgrade their link to PCIe Gen4 speed when faced with unstable link at "
"Gen5, which makes firmware updates rather risky on such setups. It is "
"required to ensure that the device is capable of auto-downgrading its link "
"to PCIe Gen4 speed before pushing the firmware image with PCIe Gen5 as "
"default configuration. This can be done by reading "
"``auto_link_downgrade_capable`` sysfs entry, which will denote if the device "
