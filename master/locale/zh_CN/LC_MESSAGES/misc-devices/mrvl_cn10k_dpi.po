"DPI is a DMA packet interface hardware block in Marvell's CN10K silicon. DPI "
"hardware comprises a physical function (PF), its virtual functions, mailbox "
"logic, and a set of DMA engines & DMA command queues."

"DPI PF function is an administrative function which services the mailbox "
"requests from its VF functions and provisions DMA engine resources to it's "
"VF functions."

"mrvl_cn10k_dpi.ko misc driver loads on DPI PF device and services the "
"mailbox commands submitted by the VF devices and accordingly initializes the "
"DMA engines and VF device's DMA command queues. Also, driver creates /dev/"
"mrvl-cn10k-dpi node to set DMA engine and PEM (PCIe interface) port "
"attributes like fifo length, molr, mps & mrrs."
