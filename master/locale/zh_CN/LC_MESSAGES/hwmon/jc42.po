"This driver implements support for JEDEC JC 42.4 compliant temperature "
"sensors, which are used on many DDR3 memory modules for mobile devices and "
"servers. Some systems use the sensor to prevent memory overheating by "
"automatically throttling the memory controller."

"A JC 42.4 compliant chip supports a single temperature sensor. Minimum, "

"high, low, and critical thresholds."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/jc42.rst:126
msgid ""
"There is also an hysteresis to control the thresholds for resetting alarms. "
"Per JC 42.4 specification, the hysteresis threshold can be configured to 0, "
"1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 degrees C. Configured hysteresis values will be rounded to "
"those limits. The chip supports only a single register to configure the "
"hysteresis, which applies to all limits. This register can be written by "
"writing into temp1_crit_hyst. Other hysteresis attributes are read-only."
