"This driver enables the use of a PWM module to drive a fan. It uses the "
"generic PWM interface thus it is hardware independent. It can be used on "
"many SoCs, as long as the SoC supplies a PWM line driver that exposes the "
"generic PWM API."

"The driver implements a simple interface for driving a fan connected to a "
"PWM output. It uses the generic PWM interface, thus it can be used with a "
"range of SoCs. The driver exposes the fan to the user space through the "
"hwmon's sysfs interface."
