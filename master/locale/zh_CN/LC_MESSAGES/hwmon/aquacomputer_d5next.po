"This driver exposes hardware sensors of listed Aquacomputer devices, which "
"communicate through proprietary USB HID protocols."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/aquacomputer_d5next.rst:30
msgid ""
"The Aquaero devices expose eight physical, eight virtual and four calculated "
"virtual temperature sensors, as well as two flow sensors. The fans expose "
"their speed (in RPM), power, voltage and current. Temperature offsets and "
"fan speeds can be controlled."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/aquacomputer_d5next.rst:35
msgid ""
"For the D5 Next pump, available sensors are pump and fan speed, power, "
"voltage and current, as well as coolant temperature and eight virtual temp "
"sensors. Also available through debugfs are the serial number, firmware "
"version and power-on count. Attaching a fan to it is optional and allows it "
"to be controlled using temperature curves directly from the pump. If it's "
"not connected, the fan-related sensors will report zeroes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/aquacomputer_d5next.rst:42
msgid ""
"The pump can be configured either through software or via its physical "
"interface. Configuring the pump through this driver is not implemented, as "
"it seems to require sending it a complete configuration. That includes "
"addressable RGB LEDs, for which there is no standard sysfs interface. Thus, "
"that task is better suited for userspace tools."

"The Octo exposes four physical and sixteen virtual temperature sensors, a "

"The High Flow Next exposes +5V voltages, water quality, conductivity and "
"flow readings. A temperature sensor can be connected to it, in which case it "
"provides its reading and an estimation of the dissipated/absorbed power in "
"the liquid cooling loop."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/aquacomputer_d5next.rst:63
msgid ""
"The Leakshield exposes two temperature sensors and coolant pressure "
"(current, min, max and target readings). It also exposes the estimated "
"reservoir volume and how much of it is filled with coolant. Pump RPM and "
"flow can be set to enhance on-device calculations, but this is not yet "
"implemented here."
