"Avoid calculations in macros and macro-generated functions. While such "
"macros may save a line or so in the source, it obfuscates the code and makes "
"code review more difficult. It may also result in code which is more "
"complicated than necessary. Such macros may also evaluate their arguments "
"multiple times. This leads to Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race "
"conditions when accessing shared data without locking, for example when "
"calculating values in sysfs show functions. Use inline functions or just "
"regular functions instead."

"Limit the number of kernel log messages. In general, your driver should not "

"that kernel error log messages not only fill up the kernel log, but also are "
"printed synchronously, most likely with interrupt disabled, often to a "
"serial console. Excessive logging can seriously affect system performance."
