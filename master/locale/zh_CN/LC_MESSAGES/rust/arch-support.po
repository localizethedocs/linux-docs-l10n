"Currently, the Rust compiler (``rustc``) uses LLVM for code generation, "
"which limits the supported architectures that can be targeted. In addition, "
"support for building the kernel with LLVM/Clang varies (please see "
"Documentation/kbuild/llvm.rst). This support is needed for ``bindgen`` which "
"uses ``libclang``."
