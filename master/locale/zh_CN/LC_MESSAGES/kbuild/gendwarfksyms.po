"When CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is enabled, symbol versions for modules are "
"typically calculated from preprocessed source code using the **genksyms** "
"tool.  However, this is incompatible with languages such as Rust, where the "
"source code has insufficient information about the resulting ABI. With "
"CONFIG_GENDWARFKSYMS (and CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO) selected, **gendwarfksyms** is "
"used instead to calculate symbol versions from the DWARF debugging "
"information, which contains the necessary details about the final module ABI."
