"The linux kernel's exported header files describe the API for user space "
"programs attempting to use kernel services.  These kernel header files are "
"used by the system's C library (such as glibc or uClibc) to define available "
"system calls, as well as constants and structures to be used with these "
"system calls.  The C library's header files include the kernel header files "
"from the \"linux\" subdirectory.  The system's libc headers are usually "
"installed at the default location /usr/include and the kernel headers in "
"subdirectories under that (most notably /usr/include/linux and /usr/include/"
"asm)."

"Kernel headers are backwards compatible, but not forwards compatible.  This "
"means that a program built against a C library using older kernel headers "
"should run on a newer kernel (although it may not have access to new "
"features), but a program built against newer kernel headers may not work on "
"an older kernel."
