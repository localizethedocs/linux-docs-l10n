"On Intel processors, KVM uses Intel's VMX (Virtual-Machine eXtensions) to "
"easily and efficiently run guest operating systems. Normally, these guests "
"*cannot* themselves be hypervisors running their own guests, because in VMX, "
"guests cannot use VMX instructions."

"The \"Nested VMX\" feature adds this missing capability - of running guest "
"hypervisors (which use VMX) with their own nested guests. It does so by "
"allowing a guest to use VMX instructions, and correctly and efficiently "
"emulating them using the single level of VMX available in the hardware."

"Single-level virtualization has two levels - the host (KVM) and the guests. "

"call L0, the guest hypervisor, which we call L1, and its nested guest, which "
"we call L2."

"Nested VMX aims to present a standard and (eventually) fully-functional VMX "
"implementation for the a guest hypervisor to use. As such, the official "
"specification of the ABI that it provides is Intel's VMX specification, "
"namely volume 3B of their \"Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software "
"Developer's Manual\". Not all of VMX's features are currently fully "
"supported, but the goal is to eventually support them all, starting with the "
"VMX features which are used in practice by popular hypervisors (KVM and "
"others)."

"As a VMX implementation, nested VMX presents a VMCS structure to L1. As "
"mandated by the spec, other than the two fields revision_id and abort, this "
"structure is *opaque* to its user, who is not supposed to know or care about "
"its internal structure. Rather, the structure is accessed through the VMREAD "
"and VMWRITE instructions. Still, for debugging purposes, KVM developers "
"might be interested to know the internals of this structure; This is struct "

"The name \"vmcs12\" refers to the VMCS that L1 builds for L2. In the code we "

"VMCS which L0 builds to actually run L2 - how this is done is explained in "

"vmcs12 or its inner struct shadow_vmcs is ever changed."
