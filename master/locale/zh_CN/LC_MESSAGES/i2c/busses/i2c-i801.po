"If your system has an Intel ICH south bridge, but you do NOT see the SMBus "

"The first thing to try is the \"i2c-scmi\" ACPI driver. It could be that the "

"unhide the ICH SMBus. Even if i2c-scmi doesn't work, you better make sure "
"that the SMBus isn't used by the ACPI code. Try loading the \"fan\" and "
"\"thermal\" drivers, and check in /sys/class/thermal. If you find a thermal "
"zone with type \"acpitz\", it's likely that the ACPI is accessing the SMBus "
