"This is a driver for the evaluation modules for TAOS I2C/SMBus chips. The "
"modules include an SMBus master with limited capabilities, which can be "
"controlled over the serial port. Virtually all evaluation modules are "
"supported, but a few lines of code need to be added for each new module to "
"instantiate the right I2C chip on the bus. Obviously, a driver for the chip "
"in question is also needed."

"The communication protocol is text-based and pretty simple. It is described "
"in a PDF document on the CD which comes with the evaluation module. The "
"communication is rather slow, because the serial port has to operate at 1200 "
"bps. However, I don't think this is a big concern in practice, as these "
"modules are meant for evaluation and testing only."
