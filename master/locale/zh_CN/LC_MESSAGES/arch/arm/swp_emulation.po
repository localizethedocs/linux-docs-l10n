"ARMv6 architecture deprecates use of the SWP/SWPB instructions, and "

"and STREX."

"ARMv7 multiprocessing extensions introduce the ability to disable these "
"instructions, triggering an undefined instruction exception when executed. "
"Trapped instructions are emulated using an LDREX/STREX or LDREXB/STREXB "
"sequence. If a memory access fault (an abort) occurs, a segmentation fault "
"is signalled to the triggering process."

"when accessing uncached shared regions, LDREX/STREX rely on an external "
"transaction monitoring block called a global monitor to maintain update "
"atomicity. If your system does not implement a global monitor, this option "
"can cause programs that perform SWP operations to uncached memory to "
"deadlock, as the STREX operation will always fail."
