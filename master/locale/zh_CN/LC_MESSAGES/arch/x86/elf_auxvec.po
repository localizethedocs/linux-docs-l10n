"AT_MINSIGSTKSZ denotes the minimum stack size required by the kernel to "
"deliver a signal to user-space.  AT_MINSIGSTKSZ comprehends the space "
"consumed by the kernel to accommodate the user context for the current "
"hardware configuration.  It does not comprehend subsequent user-space stack "
"consumption, which must be added by the user.  (e.g. Above, user-space adds "
"SIGSTKSZ to AT_MINSIGSTKSZ.)"
