"Also known as \"USB Keyboard\" or \"USB Mouse support\" in the BIOS Setup is "
"a feature that allows one to use the USB mouse and keyboard as if they were "
"their classic PS/2 counterparts.  This means one can use an USB keyboard to "
"type in LILO for example."

"On some machines, the emulated PS/2 mouse takes over even when no USB mouse "
"is present and a real PS/2 mouse is present.  In that case the extra "
"features (wheel, extra buttons, touchpad mode) of the real PS/2 mouse may "
"not be available."

"If AMD64 64-bit mode is enabled, again system crashes often happen, because "
"the SMM BIOS isn't expecting the CPU to be in 64-bit mode.  The BIOS "
"manufacturers only test with Windows, and Windows doesn't do 64-bit yet."

"can be solved by loading the USB drivers prior to loading the PS/2 mouse "
"driver. Since the PS/2 mouse driver is in 2.6 compiled into the kernel "
"unconditionally, this means the USB drivers need to be compiled-in, too."

"is usually fixed by a BIOS update. Check the board manufacturers web site. "
"If an update is not available, disable USB Legacy support in the BIOS. If "
"this alone doesn't help, try also adding idle=poll on the kernel command "
"line. The BIOS may be entering the SMM on the HLT instruction as well."
