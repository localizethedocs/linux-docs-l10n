"The arguments are split into three groups: an array of key-value pairs, a "
"CPU set, and some flags. The key-value pairs are supplied with a count. "
"Userspace must prepopulate the key field for each element, and the kernel "
"will fill in the value if the key is recognized. If a key is unknown to the "
"kernel, its key field will be cleared to -1, and its value set to 0. The CPU "
"set is defined by CPU_SET(3) with size ``cpusetsize`` bytes. For value-like "
"keys (eg. vendor, arch, impl), the returned value will only be valid if all "
"CPUs in the given set have the same value. Otherwise -1 will be returned. "
"For boolean-like keys, the value returned will be a logical AND of the "
"values for the specified CPUs. Usermode can supply NULL for ``cpus`` and 0 "
"for ``cpusetsize`` as a shortcut for all online CPUs. The currently "
"supported flags are:"

":c:macro:`RISCV_HWPROBE_WHICH_CPUS`: This flag basically reverses the "
"behavior of sys_riscv_hwprobe().  Instead of populating the values of keys "
"for a given set of CPUs, the values of each key are given and the set of "
"CPUs is reduced by sys_riscv_hwprobe() to only those which match each of the "
"key-value pairs. How matching is done depends on the key type.  For value-"
"like keys, matching means to be the exact same as the value.  For boolean-"
"like keys, matching means the result of a logical AND of the pair's value "
"with the CPU's value is exactly the same as the pair's value.  Additionally, "
"when ``cpus`` is an empty set, then it is initialized to all online CPUs "
"which fit within it, i.e. the CPU set returned is the reduction of all the "
"online CPUs which can be represented with a CPU set of size ``cpusetsize``."
