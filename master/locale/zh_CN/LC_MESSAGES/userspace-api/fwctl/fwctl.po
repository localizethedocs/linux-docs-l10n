"Modern devices contain extensive amounts of FW, and in many cases, are "
"largely software-defined pieces of hardware. The evolution of this approach "
"is largely a reaction to Moore's Law where a chip tape out is now highly "
"expensive, and the chip design is extremely large. Replacing fixed HW logic "
"with a flexible and tightly coupled FW/HW combination is an effective risk "
"mitigation against chip respin. Problems in the HW design can be "
"counteracted in device FW. This is especially true for devices which present "
"a stable and backwards compatible interface to the operating system driver "
"(such as NVMe)."

"The FW layer in devices has grown to incredible size and devices frequently "
"integrate clusters of fast processors to run it. For example, mlx5 devices "
"have over 30MB of FW code, and big configurations operate with over 1GB of "
"FW managed runtime state."

"The availability of such a flexible layer has created quite a variety in the "
"industry where single pieces of silicon are now configurable software-"
"defined devices and can operate in substantially different ways depending on "
"the need. Further, we often see cases where specific sites wish to operate "
"devices in ways that are highly specialized and require applications that "
"have been tailored to their unique configuration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/fwctl/fwctl.rst:33
msgid ""
"Further, devices have become multi-functional and integrated to the point "
"they no longer fit neatly into the kernel's division of subsystems. Modern "
"multi-functional devices have drivers, such as bnxt/ice/mlx5/pds, that span "
"many subsystems while sharing the underlying hardware using the auxiliary "
"device system."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/fwctl/fwctl.rst:39

"All together this creates a challenge for the operating system, where "
"devices have an expansive FW environment that needs robust device-specific "
"debugging support, and FW-driven functionality that is not well suited to "
"“generic” interfaces. fwctl seeks to allow access to the full device "
"functionality from user space in the areas of debuggability, management, and "
"first-boot/nth-boot provisioning."

#: ../../../userspace-api/fwctl/fwctl.rst:46

"fwctl is aimed at the common device design pattern where the OS and FW "
"communicate via an RPC message layer constructed with a queue or mailbox "
"scheme. In this case the driver will typically have some layer to deliver "
"RPC messages and collect RPC responses from device FW. The in-kernel "
"subsystem drivers that operate the device for its primary purposes will use "
"these RPCs to build their drivers, but devices also usually have a set of "
"ancillary RPCs that don't really fit into any specific subsystem. For "
"example, a HW RAID controller is primarily operated by the block layer but "
"also comes with a set of RPCs to administer the construction of drives "
"within the HW RAID."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/fwctl/fwctl.rst:56
msgid ""
"In the past when devices were more single function, individual subsystems "
"would grow different approaches to solving some of these common problems. "
"For instance, monitoring device health, manipulating its FLASH, debugging "
"the FW, provisioning, all have various unique interfaces across the kernel."

"fwctl's purpose is to define a common set of limited rules, described below, "
"that allow user space to securely construct and execute RPCs inside device "
"FW. The rules serve as an agreement between the operating system and FW on "
"how to correctly design the RPC interface. As a uAPI the subsystem provides "
"a thin layer of discovery and a generic uAPI to deliver the RPCs and collect "
"the response. It supports a system of user space libraries and tools which "
"will use this interface to control the device using the device native "
"protocols."
