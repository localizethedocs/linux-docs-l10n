"The PDS Core device makes a fwctl service available through an "
"auxiliary_device named pds_core.fwctl.N.  The pds_fwctl driver binds to this "
"device and registers itself with the fwctl subsystem.  The resulting "
"userspace interface is used by an application that is a part of the AMD "
"Pensando software package for the Distributed Service Card (DSC)."

"The pds_fwctl driver has little knowledge of the firmware's internals. It "
"only knows how to send commands through pds_core's message queue to the "
"firmware for fwctl requests.  The set of fwctl operations available depends "
"on the firmware in the DSC, and the userspace application version must match "
"the firmware so that they can talk to each other."

"When a connection is created the pds_fwctl driver requests from the firmware "
"a list of firmware object endpoints, and for each endpoint the driver "
"requests a list of operations for that endpoint."

"Each operation description includes a firmware defined command attribute "
"that maps to the FWCTL scope levels.  The driver translates those firmware "
"values into the FWCTL scope values which can then be used for filtering the "
"scoped user requests."

"Each RPC request includes the target endpoint and the operation id, and in "
"and out buffer lengths and pointers.  The driver verifies the existence of "
"the requested endpoint and operations, then checks the request scope against "
"the required scope of the operation.  The request is then put together with "
"the request data and sent through pds_core's message queue to the firmware, "
"and the results are returned to the caller."

"The RPC endpoints, operations, and buffer contents are defined by the "
