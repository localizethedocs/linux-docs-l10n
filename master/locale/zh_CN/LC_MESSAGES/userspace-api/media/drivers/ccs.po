msgid ""
"The MIPI CCS camera sensor driver is a generic driver for `MIPI CCS <https://"
"www.mipi.org/specifications/camera-command-set>`_ compliant camera sensors. "
"It exposes three sub-devices representing the pixel array, the binner and "
"the scaler."

"As the capabilities of individual devices vary, the driver exposes "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/media/drivers/ccs.rst:23
msgid ""
"The pixel array sub-device represents the camera sensor's pixel matrix, as "
"well as analogue crop functionality present in many compliant devices. The "
"analogue crop is configured using the ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP`` on the source "
"pad (0) of the entity. The size of the pixel matrix can be obtained by "
"getting the ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_NATIVE_SIZE`` target."

"The binner sub-device represents the binning functionality on the sensor. "
"For that purpose, selection target ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE`` is supported on "
"the sink pad (0)."

"The scaler sub-device represents the digital crop and scaling functionality "
"of the sensor. The V4L2 selection target ``V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP`` is used to "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/media/drivers/ccs.rst:56
msgid ""
"Digital crop functionality is referred to as cropping that effectively works "
"by dropping some data on the floor. Analogue crop, on the other hand, means "
"that the cropped information is never retrieved. In case of camera sensors, "
"the analogue data is never read from the pixel matrix that are outside the "
"configured selection rectangle that designates crop. The difference has an "
"effect in device timing and likely also in power consumption."
