"The first API for Digital TV cards we used at Convergence in late 1999 was "
"an extension of the Video4Linux API which was primarily developed for frame "
"grabber cards. As such it was not really well suited to be used for Digital "
"TV cards and their new features like recording MPEG streams and filtering "
"several section and PES data streams at the same time."

"In early 2000, Convergence was approached by Nokia with a proposal for a new "
"standard Linux Digital TV API. As a commitment to the development of "
"terminals based on open standards, Nokia and Convergence made it available "
"to all Linux developers and published it on https://linuxtv.org in September "
"2000. With the Linux driver for the Siemens/Hauppauge DVB PCI card, "
"Convergence provided a first implementation of the Linux Digital TV API. "
"Convergence was the maintainer of the Linux Digital TV API in the early days."

"Now, the API is maintained by the LinuxTV community (i.e. you, the reader of "

"improved together with the improvements at the subsystem's core at the "

"The Linux Digital TV API lets you control these hardware components through "

"demodulator. The demux device gives you control over the PES and section "
"filters of the hardware. If the hardware does not support filtering these "
"filters can be implemented in software. Finally, the CA device controls all "
"the conditional access capabilities of the hardware. It can depend on the "
