"The bpf_redirect() and bpf_redirect_map() helpers will lookup the target of "

"When the program returns the XDP_REDIRECT return code, the driver will call "

msgid ""
"Before exiting its NAPI poll loop, the driver will call xdp_do_flush(), "
"which will flush all the different bulk queues, thus completing the "
"redirect. Note that xdp_do_flush() must be called before "
"napi_complete_done() in the driver, as the XDP_REDIRECT logic relies on "
"being inside a single NAPI instance through to the xdp_do_flush() call for "
"RCU protection of all in-kernel data structures."
