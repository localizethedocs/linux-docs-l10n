"/proc/irq/IRQ#/smp_affinity and /proc/irq/IRQ#/smp_affinity_list specify "
"which target CPUs are permitted for a given IRQ source.  It's a bitmask "
"(smp_affinity) or CPU list (smp_affinity_list) of allowed CPUs.  It's not "
"allowed to turn off all CPUs, and if an IRQ controller does not support IRQ "
"affinity then the value will not change from the default of all CPUs."

"/proc/irq/default_smp_affinity specifies default affinity mask that applies "
"to all non-active IRQs. Once IRQ is allocated/activated its affinity bitmask "
"will be set to the default mask. It can then be changed as described above. "
"Default mask is 0xffffffff."
