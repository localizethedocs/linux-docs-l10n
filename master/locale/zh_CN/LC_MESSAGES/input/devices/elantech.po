"Currently the Linux Elantech touchpad driver is aware of four different "
"hardware versions unimaginatively called version 1,version 2, version 3 and "
"version 4. Version 1 is found in \"older\" laptops and uses 4 bytes per "
"packet. Version 2 seems to be introduced with the EeePC and uses 6 bytes per "
"packet, and provides additional features such as position of two fingers, "
"and width of the touch.  Hardware version 3 uses 6 bytes per packet (and for "
"2 fingers the concatenation of two 6 bytes packets) and allows tracking of "
"up to 3 fingers. Hardware version 4 uses 6 bytes per packet, and can combine "
"a status packet with multiple head or motion packets. Hardware version 4 "
"allows tracking up to 5 fingers."
