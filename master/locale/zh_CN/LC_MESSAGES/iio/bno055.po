"Accelerometer, magnetometer and gyroscope measures are always provided. When "
"\"fusion_enable\" sysfs attribute is set to 1, orientation (both Euler "
"angles and quaternion), linear velocity and gravity vector are also "
"provided, but some sensor settings (e.g. low pass filtering and range) "
"became locked (the IMU firmware controls them)."

"The IMU continuously performs an autocalibration procedure if (and only if) "
"operating in fusion mode. The magnetometer autocalibration can however be "
"disabled by writing 0 in the sysfs in_magn_calibration_fast_enable attribute."

"The driver provides access to autocalibration flags (i.e. you can known if "
"the IMU has successfully autocalibrated) and to the calibration data blob."

#: ../../../iio/bno055.rst:30
msgid ""
"The user can save this blob in a firmware file (i.e. in /lib/firmware) that "
"the driver looks for at probe time. If found, then the IMU is initialized "
"with this calibration data. This saves the user from performing the "
"calibration procedure every time (which consist of moving the IMU in various "
"way)."

msgid ""
"The driver looks for calibration data file using two different names: first "
"a file whose name is suffixed with the IMU unique ID (exposed in sysfs as "
"serial_number) is searched for; this is useful when there is more than one "
"IMU instance. If this file is not found, then a \"generic\" calibration file "
"is searched for (which can be used when only one IMU is present, without "
"struggling with fancy names, that change on each device)."

"In non-fusion mode the IIO 'offset' attributes provide access to the offsets "
"from calibration data (if any), so that the user can apply them to the "
"accel, angvel and magn IIO attributes. In fusion mode they are not needed "
"(the IMU firmware internally applies those corrections) and they read as "
"zero."
