"The HDQ/1-Wire module of TI OMAP2430/3430 platforms implement the hardware "
"protocol of the master functions of the Benchmark HDQ and the Dallas "
"Semiconductor 1-Wire protocols. These protocols use a single wire for "
"communication between the master (HDQ/1-Wire controller) and the slave "
"(HDQ/1-Wire external compliant device)."

"A typical application of the HDQ/1-Wire module is the communication with "
"battery monitor (gas gauge) integrated circuits."

"The controller supports operation in both HDQ and 1-wire mode. The essential "
"difference between the HDQ and 1-wire mode is how the slave device responds "
"to initialization pulse.In HDQ mode, the firmware does not require the host "
"to create an initialization pulse to the slave.However, the slave can be "
"reset by using an initialization pulse (also referred to as a break pulse)."
"The slave does not respond with a presence pulse as it does in the 1-Wire "
"protocol."

"The driver (drivers/w1/masters/omap_hdq.c) supports the HDQ mode of the "
"controller. In this mode, as we can not read the ID which obeys the W1 "
"spec(family:id:crc), a module parameter can be passed to the driver which "
"will be used to calculate the CRC and pass back an appropriate slave ID to "
"the W1 core."

"By default the master driver and the BQ slave i/f driver(drivers/w1/slaves/"

"different ID if required, but note that the ID used should be same for both "
"master and slave driver loading."

"The driver also supports 1-wire mode. In this mode, there is no need to pass "

"bus using SEARCH_ROM procedure. 1-wire mode can be selected by setting \"ti,"
"mode\" property to \"1w\" in DT (see Documentation/devicetree/bindings/w1/"
"omap-hdq.txt for more details). By default driver is in HDQ mode."
