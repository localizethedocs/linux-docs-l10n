msgid ""
"The PC is given full control over the radio channel. Special control data is "
"exchanged between the PC and the TNC so that the PC knows at any time if the "
"TNC is receiving data, if a TNC buffer underrun or overrun has occurred, if "
"the PTT is set and so on. This control data is processed at a higher "
"priority than normal data, so a data stream can be interrupted at any time "
"to issue an important event. This helps to improve the channel access and "
"timing algorithms as everything is computed in the PC. It would even be "
"possible to experiment with something completely different from the known "
"CSMA and DAMA channel access methods. This kind of real-time control is "
"especially important to supply several TNCs that are connected between each "
"other and the PC by a daisy chain (however, this feature is not supported "
"yet by the Linux 6pack driver)."

"Each packet transferred over the serial line is supplied with a checksum, so "

"The 6pack protocol has been developed by Ekki Plicht DF4OR, Henning Rech "
"DF9IC and Gunter Jost DK7WJ. A driver for 6pack, written by Gunter Jost and "

msgid ""
"To be able to use 6pack, a special firmware for the TNC is needed. The EPROM "
"of a newly bought TNC does not contain 6pack, so you will have to program an "
"EPROM yourself. The image file for 6pack EPROMs should be available on any "
"packet radio box where PC/FlexNet can be found. The name of the file is "
"6pack.bin. This file is copyrighted and maintained by the FlexNet team. It "
"can be used under the terms of the license that comes along with PC/FlexNet. "
"Please do not ask me about the internals of this file as I don't know "
"anything about it. I used a textual description of the 6pack protocol to "
"program the Linux driver."

"TNCs contain a 64kByte EPROM, the lower half of which is used for the "
"firmware/KISS. The upper half is either empty or is sometimes programmed "
"with software called TAPR. In the latter case, the TNC is supplied with a "
"DIP switch so you can easily change between the two systems. When "
"programming a new EPROM, one of the systems is replaced by 6pack. It is "
"useful to replace TAPR, as this software is rarely used nowadays. If your "
"TNC is not equipped with the switch mentioned above, you can build in one "
"yourself that switches over the highest address pin of the EPROM between "
"HIGH and LOW level. After having inserted the new EPROM and switched to "
"6pack, apply power to the TNC for a first test. The connect and the status "
"LED are lit for about a second if the firmware initialises the TNC correctly."

"on if there is data in the buffer of the PC's AX.25 engine that has to be "
"transmitted. Under Linux, the 6pack layer is beyond the AX.25 layer, so the "
"6pack driver doesn't know anything about connects or data that has not yet "
"been transmitted. Therefore the LEDs are controlled as they are in KISS "

"When testing the driver with 2.0.3x kernels and operating with data rates on "

"systems, sometimes print the message '6pack: bad checksum', which is due to "
"data loss if the other station sends two or more subsequent packets. I have "
