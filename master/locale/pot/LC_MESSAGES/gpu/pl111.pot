"The driver currently doesn't expose the cursor.  The DRM API for cursors "
"requires support for 64x64 ARGB8888 cursor images, while the hardware can "
"only support 64x64 monochrome with masking cursors.  While one could imagine "
"trying to hack something together to look at the ARGB8888 and program "
"reasonable in monochrome, we just don't expose the cursor at all instead, "
"and leave cursor support to the application software cursor layer."
