"The MCDE (short for multi-channel display engine) is a graphics controller "
"found in the Ux500 chipsets, such as NovaThor U8500. It was initially "
"conceptualized by ST Microelectronics for the successor of the Nomadik line, "
"STn8500 but productified in the ST-Ericsson U8500 where is was used for mass-"
"market deployments in Android phones from Samsung and Sony Ericsson."

"It can do 1080p30 on SDTV CCIR656, DPI-2, DBI-2 or DSI for panels with or "
"without frame buffering and can convert most input formats including most "
"variants of RGB and YUV."

"FIFOs A and B are for LCD and HDMI while FIFO CO/C1 are for panels with "
"embedded buffer. 6 of the formatters are for DSI, 3 pairs for VID/CMD "
"respectively. 2 of the formatters are for DPI."

"Behind the formatters are the DSI or DPI ports that route to the external "
"pins of the chip. As there are 3 DSI ports and one DPI port, it is possible "
"to configure up to 4 display pipelines (effectively using channels 0..3) for "
"concurrent use."

"In the current DRM/KMS setup, we use one external source, one overlay, one "
"FIFO and one formatter which we connect to the simple DMA framebuffer "
"helpers. We then provide a bridge to the DSI port, and on the DSI port "
"bridge we connect hang a panel bridge or other bridge. This may be subject "
"to change as we exploit more of the hardware capabilities."
