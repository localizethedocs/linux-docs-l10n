"Maintaining the same code base across multiple OSes requires a lot of "
"synchronization effort between repositories and exhaustive validation. In "
"the DC case, we maintain a tree to centralize code from different parts. The "
"shared repository has integration tests with our Internal Linux CI farm, and "
"we run a comprehensive set of IGT tests in various AMD GPUs/APUs (mostly "
"recent dGPUs and APUs). Our CI also checks ARM64/32, PPC64/32, and x86_64/32 "
"compilation with DCN enabled and disabled."
