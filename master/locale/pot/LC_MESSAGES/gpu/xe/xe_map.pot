"All access to any memory shared with a device (both sysmem and vram) in the "
"XE driver should go through this layer (xe_map). This layer is built on top "
"of :ref:`driver-api/device-io:Generalizing Access to System and I/O Memory` "
"and with extra hooks into the XE driver that allows adding asserts to memory "
"accesses (e.g. for blocking runtime_pm D3Cold on Discrete Graphics)."
