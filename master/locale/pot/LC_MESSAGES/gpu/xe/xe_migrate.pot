"The XE migrate layer is used generate jobs which can copy memory (eviction), "
"clear memory, or program tables (binds). This layer exists in every GT, has "
"a migrate engine, and uses a special VM for all generated jobs."

#: ../../../gpu/xe/xe_migrate:7: drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_migrate_doc.h:17
msgid ""
"The special VM is configured with a page structure where we can dynamically "
"map BOs which need to be copied and cleared, dynamically map other VM's page "
"table BOs for updates, and identity map the entire device's VRAM with 1 GB "
"pages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../gpu/xe/xe_migrate:7: drivers/gpu/drm/xe/xe_migrate_doc.h:22
msgid ""
"Currently the page structure consists of 32 physical pages with 16 being "
"reserved for BO mapping during copies and clear, 1 reserved for kernel "
"binds, several pages are needed to setup the identity mappings (exact number "
"based on how many bits of address space the device has), and the rest are "
"reserved user bind operations."

"A bind job consist of two batches and runs either on the migrate engine "
"(kernel binds) or the bind engine passed in (user binds). In both cases the "
"VM of the engine is the migrate VM."

"The first batch is used to update the migration VM page structure to point "
"to the bind VM page table BOs which need to be updated. A physical page is "
"required for this. If it is a user bind, the page is allocated from pool of "
"pages reserved user bind operations with drm_suballoc managing this pool. If "
"it is a kernel bind, the page reserved for kernel binds is used."

"The first batch is only required for devices without VRAM as when the device "

"The second batch is used to program page table updated in the bind VM. Why "

"Like binds, the first batch is used update the migration VM page structure. "
"In copy jobs, we need to map the source and destination of the BO into page "
"the structure. In clear jobs, we just need to add 1 mapping of BO into the "
"page structure. We use the 16 reserved pages in migration VM for mappings, "
