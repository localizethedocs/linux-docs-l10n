"Different vendors use the term \"tile\" a bit differently, but in the Intel "
"world, a 'tile' is pretty close to what most people would think of as being "
"a complete GPU.  When multiple GPUs are placed behind a single PCI device, "
"that's what is referred to as a \"multi-tile device.\"  In such cases, "
"pretty much all hardware is replicated per-tile, although certain "
"responsibilities like PCI communication, reporting of interrupts to the OS, "
"etc. are handled solely by the \"root tile.\"  A multi-tile platform takes "
"care of tying the tiles together in a way such that interrupt notifications "
"from remote tiles are forwarded to the root tile, the per-tile vram is "
"combined into a single address space, etc."

"In contrast, a \"GT\" (which officially stands for \"Graphics Technology\") "
"is the subset of a GPU/tile that is responsible for implementing graphics "
"and/or media operations.  The GT is where a lot of the driver implementation "
"happens since it's where the hardware engines, the execution units, and the "
"GuC all reside."

"Historically most Intel devices were single-tile devices that contained a "
"single GT.  PVC is an example of an Intel platform built on a multi-tile "
"design (i.e., multiple GPUs behind a single PCI device); each PVC tile only "
"has a single GT.  In contrast, platforms like MTL that have separate chips "
"for render and media IP are still only a single logical GPU, but the "
"graphics and media IP blocks are each exposed as a separate GT within that "
"single GPU.  This is important from a software perspective because multi-GT "
"platforms like MTL only replicate a subset of the GPU hardware and behave "
"differently than multi-tile platforms like PVC where nearly everything is "
"replicated."
