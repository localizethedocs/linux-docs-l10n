"Therefore, the suggestion is to enable the error log and devicetree tests on "
"all (DT-based) platforms, since they don't have any requirements. Then to "
"greatly improve coverage, generate the reference for each platform and "
"enable the exist test. The discoverable bus test can be used to verify the "
"probe status of specific USB or PCI devices, but is probably not worth it "
"for most cases."
