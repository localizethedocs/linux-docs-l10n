"This document describes how the numa=fake x86_64 command-line option can be "
"used in conjunction with cpusets for coarse memory management.  Using this "
"feature, you can create fake NUMA nodes that represent contiguous chunks of "
"memory and assign them to cpusets and their attached tasks.  This is a way "
"of limiting the amount of system memory that are available to a certain "
"class of tasks."

"For the purposes of this introduction, we'll assume a very primitive NUMA "
"emulation setup of \"numa=fake=4*512,\".  This will split our system memory "
"into four equal chunks of 512M each that we can now use to assign to "
"cpusets.  As you become more familiar with using this combination for "
"resource control, you'll determine a better setup to minimize the number of "
"nodes you have to deal with."
