"CET introduces shadow stack and indirect branch tracking (IBT). A shadow "
"stack is a secondary stack allocated from memory which cannot be directly "
"modified by applications. When executing a CALL instruction, the processor "
"pushes the return address to both the normal stack and the shadow stack. "
"Upon function return, the processor pops the shadow stack copy and compares "
"it to the normal stack copy. If the two differ, the processor raises a "
"control-protection fault. IBT verifies indirect CALL/JMP targets are "
"intended as marked by the compiler with 'ENDBR' opcodes. Not all CPU's have "
"both Shadow Stack and Indirect Branch Tracking. Today in the 64-bit kernel, "
"only userspace shadow stack and kernel IBT are supported."
