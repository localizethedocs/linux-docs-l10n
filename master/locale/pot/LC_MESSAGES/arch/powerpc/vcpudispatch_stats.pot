"For Shared Processor LPARs, the POWER Hypervisor maintains a relatively "
"static mapping of the LPAR processors (vcpus) to physical processor chips "
"(representing the \"home\" node) and tries to always dispatch vcpus on their "
"associated physical processor chip. However, under certain scenarios, vcpus "
"may be dispatched on a different processor chip (away from its home node)."

"/proc/powerpc/vcpudispatch_stats can be used to obtain statistics related to "
"the vcpu dispatch behavior. Writing '1' to this file enables collecting the "
"statistics, while writing '0' disables the statistics. By default, the DTLB "
"log for each vcpu is processed 50 times a second so as not to miss any "
"entries. This processing frequency can be changed through /proc/powerpc/"
