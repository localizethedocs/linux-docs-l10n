"The LART is a small (7.5 x 10cm) SA-1100 board, designed for embedded "
"applications. It has 32 MB DRAM, 4MB Flash ROM, double RS232 and all other "
"StrongARM-gadgets. Almost all SA signals are directly accessible through a "
"number of connectors. The powersupply accepts voltages between 3.5V and 16V "
"and is overdimensioned to support a range of daughterboards. A quad "
"Ethernet / IDE / PS2 / sound daughterboard is under development, with plenty "
"of others in different stages of planning."
