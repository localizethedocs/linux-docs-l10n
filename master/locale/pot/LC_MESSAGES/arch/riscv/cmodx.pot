"CMODX is a programming technique where a program executes instructions that "
"were modified by the program itself. Instruction storage and the instruction "
"cache (icache) are not guaranteed to be synchronized on RISC-V hardware. "
"Therefore, the program must enforce its own synchronization with the "
"unprivileged fence.i instruction."

"Essentially, dynamic ftrace directs the control flow by inserting a function "
"call at each patchable function entry, and patches it dynamically at runtime "
"to enable or disable the redirection. In the case of RISC-V, 2 instructions, "
"AUIPC + JALR, are required to compose a function call. However, it is "
"impossible to patch 2 instructions and expect that a concurrent read-side "
"executes them without a race condition. This series makes atmoic code "
"patching possible in RISC-V ftrace. Kernel preemption makes things even "
"worse as it allows the old state to persist across the patching process with "
"stop_machine()."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/riscv/cmodx.rst:28
msgid ""
"In order to get rid of stop_machine() and run dynamic ftrace with full "
"kernel preemption, we partially initialize each patchable function entry at "
"boot-time, setting the first instruction to AUIPC, and the second to NOP. "
"Now, atmoic patching is possible because the kernel only has to update one "
"instruction. According to Ziccif, as long as an instruction is naturally "
"aligned, the ISA guarantee an  atomic update."

msgid ""
"By fixing down the first instruction, AUIPC, the range of the ftrace "
"trampoline is limited to +-2K from the predetermined target, ftrace_caller, "
"due to the lack of immediate encoding space in RISC-V. To address the issue, "
"we introduce CALL_OPS, where an 8B naturally align metadata is added in "
"front of each pacthable function. The metadata is resolved at the first "
"trampoline, then the execution can be derect to another custom trampoline."

"Though fence.i is an unprivileged instruction, the default Linux ABI "
"prohibits the use of fence.i in userspace applications. At any point the "
"scheduler may migrate a task onto a new hart. If migration occurs after the "
"userspace synchronized the icache and instruction storage with fence.i, the "
"icache on the new hart will no longer be clean. This is due to the behavior "
"of fence.i only affecting the hart that it is called on. Thus, the hart that "
"the task has been migrated to may not have synchronized instruction storage "
"and icache."

"There are two ways to solve this problem: use the riscv_flush_icache() "
"syscall, or use the ``PR_RISCV_SET_ICACHE_FLUSH_CTX`` prctl() and emit fence."
"i in userspace. The syscall performs a one-off icache flushing operation. "
"The prctl changes the Linux ABI to allow userspace to emit icache flushing "
"operations."

"As an aside, \"deferred\" icache flushes can sometimes be triggered in the "
"kernel. At the time of writing, this only occurs during the "
"riscv_flush_icache() syscall and when the kernel uses copy_to_user_page(). "
"These deferred flushes happen only when the memory map being used by a hart "
"changes. If the prctl() context caused an icache flush, this deferred icache "
"flush will be skipped as it is redundant. Therefore, there will be no "
"additional flush when using the riscv_flush_icache() syscall inside of the "
"prctl() context."
