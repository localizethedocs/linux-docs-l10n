"The SH-3 and SH-4 CPU families traditionally include a single partial "
"register bank (selected by SR.RB, only r0 ... r7 are banked), whereas other "
"families may have more full-featured banking or simply no such capabilities "
"at all."

"In the case of this type of banking, banked registers are mapped directly to "
"r0 ... r7 if SR.RB is set to the bank we are interested in, otherwise ldc/"
"stc can still be used to reference the banked registers (as r0_bank ... "
"r7_bank) when in the context of another bank. The developer must keep the SR."
"RB value in mind when writing code that utilizes these banked registers, for "
"obvious reasons. Userspace is also not able to poke at the bank1 values, so "
"these can be used rather effectively as scratch registers by the kernel."
