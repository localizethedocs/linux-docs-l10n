"SLIMbus (Serial Low Power Interchip Media Bus) is a specification developed "
"by MIPI (Mobile Industry Processor Interface) alliance. The bus uses master/"
"slave configuration, and is a 2-wire multi-drop implementation (clock, and "
"data)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/slimbus.rst:14
msgid ""
"Currently, SLIMbus is used to interface between application processors of "
"SoCs (System-on-Chip) and peripheral components (typically codec). SLIMbus "
"uses Time-Division-Multiplexing to accommodate multiple data channels, and a "
"control channel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/slimbus.rst:19
msgid ""
"The control channel is used for various control functions such as bus "
"management, configuration and status updates. These messages can be unicast "
"(e.g. reading/writing device specific values), or multicast (e.g. data "

"devices)"

msgid ""
"Since SLIMbus devices have mechanisms for reporting their presence, the "
"framework allows drivers to bind when corresponding devices report their "
"presence on the bus. However, it is possible that the driver needs to be "
"probed first so that it can enable corresponding SLIMbus device (e.g. power "
"it up and/or take it out of reset). To support that behavior, the framework "
"allows drivers to probe first as well  (e.g. using standard DeviceTree "
"compatibility field). This creates the necessity for the driver to know when "
"the device is functional (i.e. reported present). device_up callback is used "
"for that reason when the device reports present and is assigned a logical "
"address by the controller."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/slimbus.rst:84

"Similarly, SLIMbus devices 'report absent' when they go down. A "
"'device_down' callback notifies the driver when the device reports absent "
"and its logical address assignment is invalidated by the controller."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/slimbus.rst:88
msgid ""
"Another notification \"boot_device\" is used to notify the slim_driver when "
