"Exynos 4x12 (4212, 4412) and 5 series provide emulation mode for thermal "
"management unit. Thermal emulation mode supports software debug for TMU's "
"operation. User can set temperature manually with software code and TMU will "
"read current temperature from user value not from sensor's value."

"Enabling CONFIG_THERMAL_EMULATION option will make this support available. "
"When it's enabled, sysfs node will be created as /sys/devices/virtual/"
"thermal/thermal_zone'zone id'/emul_temp."

"The sysfs node, 'emul_node', will contain value 0 for the initial state. "
"When you input any temperature you want to update to sysfs node, it "
"automatically enable emulation mode and current temperature will be changed "
"into it."

"(Exynos also supports user changeable delay time which would be used to "
"delay of changing temperature. However, this node only uses same delay of "
"real sensing time, 938us.)"

msgid ""
"Exynos emulation mode requires that value changes and enabling are performed "
"synchronously. This means that when you want to update any value, such as "
"the delay or the next temperature, you must enable emulation mode at the "
"same time (or keep the mode enabled). If you do not, the value will fail to "
"update and the last successful value will continue to be used. For this "
"reason, this node only allows users to change the temperature. Providing a "
"single interface makes it simpler to use."
