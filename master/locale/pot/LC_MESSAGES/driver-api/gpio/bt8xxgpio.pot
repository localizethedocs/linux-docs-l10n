"A generic digital 24-port PCI GPIO card can be built out of an ordinary "
"Brooktree bt848, bt849, bt878 or bt879 based analog TV tuner card. The "

"The are several ways to access these pins. One might unsolder the whole chip "
"and put it on a custom PCI board, or one might only unsolder each individual "
"GPIO pin and solder that to some tiny wire. As the chip package really is "
"tiny there are some advanced soldering skills needed in any case."
