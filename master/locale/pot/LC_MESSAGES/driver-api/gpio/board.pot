"All platforms can enable the GPIO library, but if the platform strictly "
"requires GPIO functionality to be present, it needs to select GPIOLIB from "
"its Kconfig. Then, how GPIOs are mapped depends on what the platform uses to "
"describe its hardware layout. Currently, mappings can be defined through "
"device tree, ACPI, and platform data."
