"This framework is designed to abstract complex power-up sequences that are "
"shared between multiple logical devices in the Linux kernel."

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:16
msgid ""
"The intention is to allow consumers to obtain a power sequencing handle "
"exposed by the power sequence provider and delegate the actual requesting "
"and control of the underlying resources as well as to allow the provider to "
"mitigate any potential conflicts between multiple users behind the scenes."

msgid "Unit"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:28
msgid ""
"A unit is a discrete chunk of a power sequence. For instance one unit may "
"enable a set of regulators, another may enable a specific GPIO. Units can "
"define dependencies in the form of other units that must be enabled before "
"it itself can be."

msgid "Target"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:35
msgid ""
"A target is a set of units (composed of the \"final\" unit and its "
"dependencies) that a consumer selects by its name when requesting a handle "
"to the power sequencer. Via the dependency system, multiple targets may "
"share the same parts of a power sequence but ignore parts that are "
"irrelevant."

msgid "Descriptor"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:43
msgid ""
"A handle passed by the pwrseq core to every consumer that serves as the "
"entry point to the provider layer. It ensures coherence between different "
"users and keeps reference counting consistent."

msgid "Consumer interface"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:50
msgid ""
"The consumer API is aimed to be as simple as possible. The driver interested "
"in getting a descriptor from the power sequencer should call pwrseq_get() "
"and specify the name of the target it wants to reach in the sequence after "
"calling pwrseq_power_up(). The descriptor can be released by calling "
"pwrseq_put() and the consumer can request the powering down of its target "
"with pwrseq_power_off(). Note that there is no guarantee that "
"pwrseq_power_off() will have any effect as there may be multiple users of "
"the underlying resources who may keep them active."

msgid "Provider interface"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:62
msgid ""
"The provider API is admittedly not nearly as straightforward as the one for "
"consumers but it makes up for it in flexibility."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:65
msgid ""
"Each provider can logically split the power-up sequence into discrete chunks "
"(units) and define their dependencies. They can then expose named targets "
"that consumers may use as the final point in the sequence that they wish to "
"reach."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:69
msgid ""
"To that end the providers fill out a set of configuration structures and "
"register with the pwrseq subsystem by calling pwrseq_device_register()."

msgid "Dynamic consumer matching"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:75
msgid ""
"The main difference between pwrseq and other Linux kernel providers is the "
"mechanism for dynamic matching of consumers and providers. Every power "
"sequence provider driver must implement the `match()` callback and pass it "
"to the pwrseq core when registering with the subsystems."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pwrseq.rst:80
msgid ""
"When a client requests a sequencer handle, the core will call this callback "
"for every registered provider and let it flexibly figure out whether the "
"proposed client device is indeed its consumer. For example: if the provider "
"binds to the device-tree node representing a power management unit of a "
"chipset and the consumer driver controls one of its modules, the provider "
"driver may parse the relevant regulator supply properties in device tree and "
"see if they lead from the PMU to the consumer."
