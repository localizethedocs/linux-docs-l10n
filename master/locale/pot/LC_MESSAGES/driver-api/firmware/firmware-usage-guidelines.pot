"Users switching to a newer kernel should *not* have to install newer "
"firmware files to keep their hardware working. At the same time updated "
"firmware files must not cause any regressions for users of older kernel "
"releases."

"Drivers that use firmware from linux-firmware should follow the rules in "
"this guide. (Where there is limited control of the firmware, i.e. company "
"doesn't support Linux, firmwares sourced from misc places, then of course "
"these rules will not apply strictly.)"

"Firmware files shall be designed in a way that it allows checking for "
"firmware ABI version changes. It is recommended that firmware files be "
"versioned with at least a major/minor version. It is suggested that the "
"firmware files in linux-firmware be named with some device specific name, "
"and just the major version. The firmware version should be stored in the "
"firmware header, or as an exception, as part of the firmware file name, in "
"order to let the driver detact any non-ABI fixes/changes. The firmware files "
"in linux-firmware should be overwritten with the newest compatible major "
"version. Newer major version firmware shall remain compatible with all "
"kernels that load that major number."

"If the kernel support for the hardware is normally inactive, or the hardware "
"isn't available for public consumption, this can be ignored, until the first "
"kernel release that enables that hardware. This means no major version bumps "
"without the kernel retaining backwards compatibility for the older major "
"versions.  Minor version bumps should not introduce new features that newer "
"kernels depend on non-optionally."

"If a security fix needs lockstep firmware and kernel fixes in order to be "
"successful, then all supported major versions in the linux-firmware repo "
"that are required by currently supported stable/LTS kernels, should be "
"updated with the security fix. The kernel patches should detect if the "
"firmware is new enough to declare if the security issue is fixed.  All "
"communications around security fixes should point at both the firmware and "
"kernel fixes. If a security fix requires deprecating old major versions, "
"then this should only be done as a last option, and be stated clearly in all "
"communications."

"Firmware files that affect the User API (UAPI) shall not introduce changes "
"that break existing userspace programs. Updates to such firmware must ensure "
"backward compatibility with existing userspace applications. This includes "
"maintaining consistent interfaces and behaviors that userspace programs rely "
"on."
