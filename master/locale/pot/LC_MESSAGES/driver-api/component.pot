"The component helper allows drivers to collect a pile of sub-devices, "
"including their bound drivers, into an aggregate driver. Various subsystems "
"already provide functions to get hold of such components, e.g. "
"of_clk_get_by_name(). The component helper can be used when such a subsystem-"
"specific way to find a device is not available: The component helper fills "
"the niche of aggregate drivers for specific hardware, where further "
"standardization into a subsystem would not be practical. The common example "
"is when a logical device (e.g. a DRM display driver) is spread around the "
"SoC on various components (scanout engines, blending blocks, transcoders for "
"various outputs and so on)."
