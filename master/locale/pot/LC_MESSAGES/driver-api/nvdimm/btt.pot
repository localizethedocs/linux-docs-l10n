"Persistent memory based storage is able to perform IO at byte (or more "
"accurately, cache line) granularity. However, we often want to expose such "
"storage as traditional block devices. The block drivers for persistent "
"memory will do exactly this. However, they do not provide any atomicity "
"guarantees. Traditional SSDs typically provide protection against torn "
"sectors in hardware, using stored energy in capacitors to complete in-flight "
"block writes, or perhaps in firmware. We don't have this luxury with "
"persistent memory - if a write is in progress, and we experience a power "
"failure, the block will contain a mix of old and new data. Applications may "
"not be prepared to handle such a scenario."

"The Block Translation Table (BTT) provides atomic sector update semantics "
"for persistent memory devices, so that applications that rely on sector "
"writes not being torn can continue to do so. The BTT manifests itself as a "
"stacked block device, and reserves a portion of the underlying storage for "
"its metadata. At the heart of it, is an indirection table that re-maps all "
"the blocks on the volume. It can be thought of as an extremely simple file "
"system that only provides atomic sector updates."
