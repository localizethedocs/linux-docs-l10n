"I\\ :sup:`2`\\ C (or without fancy typography, \"I2C\") is an acronym for "
"the \"Inter-IC\" bus, a simple bus protocol which is widely used where low "
"data rate communications suffice. Since it's also a licensed trademark, some "
"vendors use another name (such as \"Two-Wire Interface\", TWI) for the same "
"bus. I2C only needs two signals (SCL for clock, SDA for data), conserving "
"board real estate and minimizing signal quality issues. Most I2C devices use "
"seven bit addresses, and bus speeds of up to 400 kHz; there's a high speed "
"extension (3.4 MHz) that's not yet found wide use. I2C is a multi-master "
"bus; open drain signaling is used to arbitrate between masters, as well as "
"to handshake and to synchronize clocks from slower clients."

"The Linux I2C programming interfaces support the master side of bus "
"interactions and the slave side. The programming interface is structured "
"around two kinds of driver, and two kinds of device. An I2C \"Adapter "
"Driver\" abstracts the controller hardware; it binds to a physical device "
"(perhaps a PCI device or platform_device) and exposes a :c:type:`struct "
"i2c_adapter <i2c_adapter>` representing each I2C bus segment it manages. On "
"each I2C bus segment will be I2C devices represented by a :c:type:`struct "
"i2c_client <i2c_client>`. Those devices will be bound to a :c:type:`struct "
"i2c_driver <i2c_driver>`, which should follow the standard Linux driver "
"model. There are functions to perform various I2C protocol operations; at "
"this writing all such functions are usable only from task context."

"The System Management Bus (SMBus) is a sibling protocol. Most SMBus systems "
"are also I2C conformant. The electrical constraints are tighter for SMBus, "
"and it standardizes particular protocol messages and idioms. Controllers "
"that support I2C can also support most SMBus operations, but SMBus "
"controllers don't support all the protocol options that an I2C controller "
"will. There are functions to perform various SMBus protocol operations, "
"either using I2C primitives or by issuing SMBus commands to i2c_adapter "
"devices which don't support those I2C operations."
