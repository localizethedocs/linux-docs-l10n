"Documentation is an important part of any software-development project. Good "
"documentation helps to bring new developers in and helps established "
"developers work more effectively.  Without top-quality documentation, a lot "
"of time is wasted in reverse-engineering the code and making avoidable "
"mistakes."

"Unfortunately, the kernel's documentation currently falls far short of what "
"it needs to be to support a project of this size and importance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../doc-guide/contributing.rst:15
msgid ""
"This guide is for contributors who would like to improve that situation. "
"Kernel documentation improvements can be made by developers at a variety of "
"skill levels; they are a relatively easy way to learn the kernel process in "
"general and find a place in the community.  The bulk of what follows is the "
"documentation maintainer's list of tasks that most urgently need to be done."

"There is an endless list of tasks that need to be carried out to get our "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The documentation build currently spews out an unbelievable number of "
"warnings.  When you have that many, you might as well have none at all; "
"people ignore them, and they will never notice when their work adds new "
"ones.  For this reason, eliminating warnings is one of the highest-priority "
"tasks on the documentation TODO list.  The task itself is reasonably "
"straightforward, but it must be approached in the right way to be successful."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Warnings issued by a compiler for C code can often be dismissed as false "
"positives, leading to patches aimed at simply shutting the compiler up. "
"Warnings from the documentation build almost always point at a real problem; "
"making those warnings go away requires understanding the problem and fixing "
"it at its source.  For this reason, patches fixing documentation warnings "
"should probably not say \"fix a warning\" in the changelog title; they "
"should indicate the real problem that has been fixed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../doc-guide/contributing.rst:49
msgid ""
"Another important point is that documentation warnings are often created by "
"problems in kerneldoc comments in C code.  While the documentation "
"maintainer appreciates being copied on fixes for these warnings, the "
"documentation tree is often not the right one to actually carry those fixes; "
"they should go to the maintainer of the subsystem in question."

"The problem is the missing \"*\", which confuses the build system's "
"simplistic idea of what C comment blocks look like.  This problem had been "
"present since that comment was added in 2016 â€” a full four years.  Fixing it "
"was a matter of adding the missing asterisks.  A quick look at the history "
"for that file showed what the normal format for subject lines is, and "
"``scripts/get_maintainer.pl`` told me who should receive it (pass paths to "
"your patches as arguments to scripts/get_maintainer.pl).  The resulting "
"patch looked like this::"

"The entire process only took a few minutes.  Of course, I then found that "
"somebody else had fixed it in a separate tree, highlighting another lesson: "

"into it."
msgstr ""

"Other fixes will take longer, especially those relating to structure members "
"or function parameters that lack documentation.  In such cases, it is "
"necessary to work out what the role of those members or parameters is and "
"describe them correctly.  Overall, this task gets a little tedious at times, "
"but it's highly important.  If we can actually eliminate warnings from the "
"documentation build, then we can start expecting developers to avoid adding "
"new ones."

"Developers are encouraged to write kerneldoc comments for their code, but "
