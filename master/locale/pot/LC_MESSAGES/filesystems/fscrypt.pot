"Unlike dm-crypt, fscrypt operates at the filesystem level rather than at the "
"block device level.  This allows it to encrypt different files with "
"different keys and to have unencrypted files on the same filesystem.  This "
"is useful for multi-user systems where each user's data-at-rest needs to be "
"cryptographically isolated from the others. However, except for filenames, "
"fscrypt does not encrypt filesystem metadata."

"Unlike eCryptfs, which is a stacked filesystem, fscrypt is integrated "
"directly into supported filesystems --- currently ext4, F2FS, UBIFS, and "
"CephFS.  This allows encrypted files to be read and written without caching "
"both the decrypted and encrypted pages in the pagecache, thereby nearly "
"halving the memory used and bringing it in line with unencrypted files.  "
"Similarly, half as many dentries and inodes are needed.  eCryptfs also "
"limits encrypted filenames to 143 bytes, causing application compatibility "
"issues; fscrypt allows the full 255 bytes (NAME_MAX).  Finally, unlike "
"eCryptfs, the fscrypt API can be used by unprivileged users, with no need to "
"mount anything."
