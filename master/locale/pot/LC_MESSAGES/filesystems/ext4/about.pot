"This document attempts to describe the on-disk format for ext4 filesystems. "
"The same general ideas should apply to ext2/3 filesystems as well, though "
"they do not support all the features that ext4 supports, and the fields will "
"be shorter."

"**NOTE**: This is a work in progress, based on notes that the author "
"(djwong) made while picking apart a filesystem by hand. The data structure "
"definitions should be current as of Linux 4.18 and e2fsprogs-1.44. All "
"comments and corrections are welcome, since there is undoubtedly plenty of "
"lore that might not be reflected in freshly created demonstration "
"filesystems."

"ext4 divides a storage device into an array of logical blocks both to reduce "
"bookkeeping overhead and to increase throughput by forcing larger transfer "
"sizes. Generally, the block size will be 4KiB (the same size as pages on x86 "
"and the block layer's default block size), though the actual size is "
"calculated as 2 ^ (10 + ``sb.s_log_block_size``) bytes. Throughout this "
"document, disk locations are given in terms of these logical blocks, not raw "
"LBAs, and not 1024-byte blocks. For the sake of convenience, the logical "
"block size will be referred to as ``$block_size`` throughout the rest of the "
"document."
