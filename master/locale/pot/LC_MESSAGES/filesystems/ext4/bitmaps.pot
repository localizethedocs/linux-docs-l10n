"As with most bitmaps, one bit represents the usage status of one data block "
"or inode table entry. This implies a block group size of 8 * "

"NOTE: If ``BLOCK_UNINIT`` is set for a given block group, various parts of "
"the kernel and e2fsprogs code pretends that the block bitmap contains zeros "
"(i.e. all blocks in the group are free). However, it is not necessarily the "
"case that no blocks are in use -- if ``meta_bg`` is set, the bitmaps and "
"group descriptor live inside the group. Unfortunately, "
"ext2fs_test_block_bitmap2() will return '0' for those locations, which "
"produces confusing debugfs output."
