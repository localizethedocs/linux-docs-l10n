"Although the Amiga and Linux file systems resemble each other, there are "

"symbolic links. While Linux has a file system with exactly one root "
"directory, the Amiga has a separate root directory for each file system (for "
"example, partition, floppy disk, ...). With the Amiga, these entities are "
"called \"volumes\". They have symbolic names which can be used to access "
"them. Thus, symbolic links can point to a different volume. AFFS turns the "
"volume name into a directory name and prepends the prefix path (see prefix "
"option) to it."

"and \"Graphics\", the mount points /amiga/User, /amiga/WB and /amiga/"
"Graphics). A symbolic link referring to \"User:sc/include/dos/dos.h\" will "
