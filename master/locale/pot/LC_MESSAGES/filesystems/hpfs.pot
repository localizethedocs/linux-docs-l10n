"As in OS/2, filenames are case insensitive. However, shell thinks that names "

"'cat FOO', 'cat Foo', 'cat foo' or 'cat F*' but not 'cat f*'. Note, that you "
"also won't be able to compile linux kernel (and maybe other things) on HPFS "
"because kernel creates different files with names like bootsect.S and "
"bootsect.s. When searching for file thats name has characters >= 128, "
"codepages are used - see below. OS/2 ignores dots and spaces at the end of "
"file name, so this driver does as well. If you create 'a. ...', the file 'a' "

#: ../../../filesystems/hpfs.rst:78
msgid ""
"On HPFS partitions, OS/2 can associate to each file a special information "
"called extended attributes. Extended attributes are pairs of (key,value) "
"where key is an ascii string identifying that attribute and value is any "
"string of bytes of variable length. OS/2 stores window and icon positions "
"and file types there. So why not use it for unix-specific info like file "
"owner or access rights? This driver can do it. If you chown/chgrp/chmod on a "
"hpfs partition, extended attributes with keys \"UID\", \"GID\" or \"MODE\" "
"and 2-byte values are created. Only that extended attributes those value "
"differs from defaults specified in mount options are created. Once created, "
"the extended attributes are never deleted, they're just changed. It means "
"that when your default uid=0 and you type something like 'chown luser file; "
"chown root file' the file will contain extended attribute UID=0. And when "
"you umount the fs and mount it again with uid=luser_uid, the file will be "
"still owned by root! If you chmod file to 444, extended attribute \"MODE\" "
"will not be set, this special case is done by setting read-only flag. When "
"you mknod a block or char device, besides \"MODE\", the special 4-byte "
"extended attribute \"DEV\" will be created containing the device number. "
"Currently this driver cannot resize extended attributes - it means that if "
"somebody (I don't know who?) has set \"UID\", \"GID\", \"MODE\" or \"DEV\" "
"attributes with different sizes, they won't be rewritten and changing these "
"values doesn't work."

"symlink results in chmoding file where symlink points. These symlinks are "
"just for Linux use and incompatible with OS/2. OS/2 PmShell symlinks are not "
"supported because they are stored in very crazy way. They tried to do it so "
"that link changes when file is moved ... sometimes it works. But the link is "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"HPFS can contain several uppercasing tables for several codepages and each "
"file has a pointer to codepage its name is in. However OS/2 was created in "
"America where people don't care much about codepages and so multiple "
"codepages support is quite buggy. I have Czech OS/2 working in codepage 852 "
"on my disk. Once I booted English OS/2 working in cp 850 and I created a "
"file on my 852 partition. It marked file name codepage as 850 - good. But "
"when I again booted Czech OS/2, the file was completely inaccessible under "
"any name. It seems that OS/2 uppercases the search pattern with its system "
"code page (852) and file name it's comparing to with its code page (850). "
"These could never match. Is it really what IBM developers wanted? But "
"problems continued. When I created in Czech OS/2 another file in that "
"directory, that file was inaccessible too. OS/2 probably uses different "
"uppercasing method when searching where to place a file (note, that files in "
"HPFS directory must be sorted) and when searching for a file. Finally when I "
"opened this directory in PmShell, PmShell crashed (the funny thing was that, "
"when rebooted, PmShell tried to reopen this directory again :-). chkdsk "
"happily ignores these errors and only low-level disk modification saved me.  "
"Never mix different language versions of OS/2 on one system although HPFS "
"was designed to allow that. OK, I could implement complex codepage support "
"to this driver but I think it would cause more problems than benefit with "
"such buggy implementation in OS/2. So this driver simply uses first codepage "
"it finds for uppercasing and lowercasing no matter what's file codepage "
"index. Usually all file names are in this codepage - if you don't try to do "
"what I described above :-)"

"replaced with another node when deleted. And that new file might have larger "
"name than the old one so the new name doesn't fit in directory node (dnode). "
"And that would result in directory tree splitting, that takes disk space. "
"Workaround is to delete other files that are leaf (probability that the file "
