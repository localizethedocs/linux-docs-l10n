"When multiple applications share a device it may be desirable to assign them "
"different priorities. Contrary to the traditional \"rm -rf /\" school of "
"thought, a video recording application could for example block other "
"applications from changing video controls or switching the current TV "
"channel. Another objective is to permit low priority applications working in "
"background, which can be preempted by user controlled applications and "
"automatically regain control of the device at a later time."

"Since these features cannot be implemented entirely in user space V4L2 "
"defines the :ref:`VIDIOC_G_PRIORITY <VIDIOC_G_PRIORITY>` and :ref:"
"`VIDIOC_S_PRIORITY <VIDIOC_G_PRIORITY>` ioctls to request and query the "
"access priority associate with a file descriptor. Opening a device assigns a "
"medium priority, compatible with earlier versions of V4L2 and drivers not "
"supporting these ioctls. Applications requiring a different priority will "
"usually call :ref:`VIDIOC_S_PRIORITY <VIDIOC_G_PRIORITY>` after verifying "
"the device with the :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` ioctl."

"Ioctls changing driver properties, such as :ref:`VIDIOC_S_INPUT "
"<VIDIOC_G_INPUT>`, return an ``EBUSY`` error code after another application "
"obtained higher priority."
