"The V4L2 API was primarily designed for devices exchanging image data with "
"applications. The struct :c:type:`v4l2_pix_format` and struct :c:type:"
"`v4l2_pix_format_mplane` structures define the format and layout of an image "
"in memory. The former is used with the single-planar API, while the latter "
"is used with the multi-planar version (see :ref:`planar-apis`). Image "
"formats are negotiated with the :ref:`VIDIOC_S_FMT <VIDIOC_G_FMT>` ioctl. "
"(The explanations here focus on video capturing and output, for overlay "
"frame buffer formats see also :ref:`VIDIOC_G_FBUF <VIDIOC_G_FBUF>`.)"
