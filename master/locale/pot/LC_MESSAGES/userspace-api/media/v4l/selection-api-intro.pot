"Some video capture devices can sample a subsection of a picture and shrink "
"or enlarge it to an image of arbitrary size. Next, the devices can insert "
"the image into larger one. Some video output devices can crop part of an "
"input image, scale it up or down and insert it at an arbitrary scan line and "
"horizontal offset into a video signal. We call these abilities cropping, "
"scaling and composing."

"On a video *capture* device the source is a video signal, and the cropping "
"target determine the area actually sampled. The sink is an image stored in a "
"memory buffer. The composing area specifies which part of the buffer is "
"actually written to by the hardware."

"On a video *output* device the source is an image in a memory buffer, and "
"the cropping target is a part of an image to be shown on a display. The sink "
"is the display or the graphics screen. The application may select the part "
"of display where the image should be displayed. The size and position of "
"such a window is controlled by the compose target."

"Rectangles for all cropping and composing targets are defined even if the "
"device does supports neither cropping nor composing. Their size and position "
"will be fixed in such a case. If the device does not support scaling then "
"the cropping and composing rectangles have the same size."
