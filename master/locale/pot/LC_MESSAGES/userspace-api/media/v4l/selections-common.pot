"While the :ref:`V4L2 selection API <selection-api>` and :ref:`V4L2 subdev "
"selection APIs <v4l2-subdev-selections>` are very similar, there's one "
"fundamental difference between the two. On sub-device API, the selection "
"rectangle refers to the media bus format, and is bound to a sub-device's "
"pad. On the V4L2 interface the selection rectangles refer to the in-memory "
"pixel format."
