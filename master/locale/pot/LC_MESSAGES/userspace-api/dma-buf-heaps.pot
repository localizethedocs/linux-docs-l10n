"Dma-buf Heaps are a way for userspace to allocate dma-buf objects. They are "
"typically used to allocate buffers from a specific allocation pool, or to "
"share buffers across frameworks."

"The ``cma`` heap allocates physically contiguous, cacheable, buffers. Only "
"present if a CMA region is present. Such a region is usually created either "
"through the kernel commandline through the ``cma`` parameter, a memory "
"region Device-Tree node with the ``linux,cma-default`` property set, or "
"through the ``CMA_SIZE_MBYTES`` or ``CMA_SIZE_PERCENTAGE`` Kconfig options. "
"The heap's name in devtmpfs is ``default_cma_region``. For backwards "
"compatibility, when the ``DMABUF_HEAPS_CMA_LEGACY`` Kconfig option is set, a "
"duplicate node is created following legacy naming conventions; the legacy "
"name might be ``reserved``, ``linux,cma``, or ``default-pool``."
