"The Linux kernel is written in the C programming language [c-language]_. "
"More precisely, it is typically compiled with ``gcc`` [gcc]_ under ``-"
"std=gnu11`` [gcc-c-dialect-options]_: the GNU dialect of ISO C11. ``clang`` "
"[clang]_ is also supported; see documentation on :ref:`Building Linux with "
"Clang/LLVM <kbuild_llvm>`."

"This dialect contains many extensions to the language [gnu-extensions]_, and "
"many of them are used within the kernel as a matter of course."

msgid ""
"One of the common extensions used throughout the kernel are attributes [gcc-"
"attribute-syntax]_. Attributes allow to introduce implementation-defined "
"semantics to language entities (like variables, functions or types) without "
"having to make significant syntactic changes to the language (e.g. adding a "
"new keyword) [n2049]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/programming-language.rst:24
msgid ""
"In some cases, attributes are optional (i.e. a compiler not supporting them "
"should still produce proper code, even if it is slower or does not perform "
"as many compile-time checks/diagnostics)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/programming-language.rst:28
msgid ""
"The kernel defines pseudo-keywords (e.g. ``__pure``) instead of using "
"directly the GNU attribute syntax (e.g. ``__attribute__((__pure__))``) in "
"order to feature detect which ones can be used and/or to shorten the code."

"The kernel has support for the Rust programming language [rust-language]_ "

"edition=2021`` [rust-editions]_. Editions are a way to introduce small "
"changes to the language that are not backwards compatible."

"On top of that, some unstable features [rust-unstable-features]_ are used in "
"the kernel. Unstable features may change in the future, thus it is an "
