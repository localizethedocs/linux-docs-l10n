"The :ref:`code_of_conduct` is a general document meant to provide a set of "
"rules for almost any open source community.  Every open-source community is "
"unique and the Linux kernel is no exception. Because of this, this document "
"describes how we in the Linux kernel community will interpret it.  We also "
"do not expect this interpretation to be static over time, and will adjust it "
"as needed."

"The Linux kernel development effort is a very personal process compared to "
"\"traditional\" ways of developing software.  Your contributions and ideas "
"behind them will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique and "
"criticism.  The review will almost always require improvements before the "
"material can be included in the kernel.  Know that this happens because "
"everyone involved wants to see the best possible solution for the overall "
"success of Linux.  This development process has been proven to create the "
"most robust operating system kernel ever, and we do not want to do anything "
"to cause the quality of submission and eventual result to ever decrease."

"That being said, our community is vast and broad, and there is no new "
