"is called/tagged ``-rc1``.  No new features get mainlined after this -- only "
"fixes to the rc1 content are expected.  After roughly a week of collecting "
"fixes to the rc1 content, rc2 is released.  This repeats on a roughly weekly "
"basis until rc7 (typically; sometimes rc6 if things are quiet, or rc8 if "
