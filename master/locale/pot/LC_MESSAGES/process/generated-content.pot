msgid "Purpose"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:8
msgid ""
"Kernel contributors have been using tooling to generate contributions for a "
"long time. These tools can increase the volume of contributions. At the same "
"time, reviewer and maintainer bandwidth is a scarce resource. Understanding "
"which portions of a contribution come from humans versus tools is helpful to "
"maintain those resources and keep kernel development healthy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:15
msgid ""
"The goal here is to clarify community expectations around tools. This lets "
"everyone become more productive while also maintaining high degrees of trust "
"between submitters and reviewers."

msgid "Out of Scope"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:22
msgid ""
"These guidelines do not apply to tools that make trivial tweaks to "
"preexisting content. Nor do they pertain to tooling that helps with menial "
"tasks. Some examples:"

"Typing aids like identifier completion, common boilerplate or trivial "

"Even whenever your tool use is out of scope, you should still always "
"consider if it would help reviewing your contribution if the reviewer knows "
"about the tool that you used."

"These guidelines apply when a meaningful amount of content in a kernel "
"contribution was not written by a person in the Signed-off-by chain, but was "
"instead created by a tool."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:44
msgid ""
"Detection of a problem and testing the fix for it is also part of the "
"development process; if a tool was used to find a problem addressed by a "
"change, that should be noted in the changelog. This not only gives credit "
"where it is due, it also helps fellow developers find out about these tools."

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:66
msgid ""
"First, read the Developer's Certificate of Origin: Documentation/process/"
"submitting-patches.rst. Its rules are simple and have been in place for a "
"long time. They have covered many tool-generated contributions. Ensure that "
"you understand your entire submission and are prepared to respond to review "
"comments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:72
msgid ""
"Second, when making a contribution, be transparent about the origin of "
"content in cover letters and changelogs. You can be more transparent by "
"adding information like this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:76
msgid "What tools were used?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:77
msgid "The input to the tools you used, like the Coccinelle source script."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:78
msgid ""
"If code was largely generated from a single or short set of prompts, include "
"those prompts. For longer sessions, include a summary of the prompts and the "
"nature of resulting assistance."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:81
msgid "Which portions of the content were affected by that tool?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:82
msgid "How is the submission tested and what tools were used to test the fix?"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:85
msgid ""
"As with all contributions, individual maintainers have discretion to choose "
"how they handle the contribution. For example, they might:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:88
msgid "Treat it just like any other contribution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:89
msgid "Reject it outright."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:90
msgid ""
"Treat the contribution specially, for example, asking for extra testing, "
"reviewing with extra scrutiny, or reviewing at a lower priority than human-"
"generated content."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:93
msgid ""
"Ask for some other special steps, like asking the contributor to elaborate "
"on how the tool or model was trained."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:95
msgid ""
"Ask the submitter to explain in more detail about the contribution so that "
"the maintainer can be assured that the submitter fully understands how the "
"code works."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:98
msgid "Suggest a better prompt instead of suggesting specific code changes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:100
msgid ""
"If tools permit you to generate a contribution automatically, expect "
"additional scrutiny in proportion to how much of it was generated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:103
msgid ""
"As with the output of any tooling, the result may be incorrect or "
"inappropriate. You are expected to understand and to be able to defend "
"everything you submit. If you are unable to do so, then do not submit the "
"resulting changes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/generated-content.rst:108
msgid ""
"If you do so anyway, maintainers are entitled to reject your series without "
"detailed review."
msgstr ""
