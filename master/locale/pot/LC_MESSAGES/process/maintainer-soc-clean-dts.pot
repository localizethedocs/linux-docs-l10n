"No changes to the SoC platform Devicetree sources (DTS files) should "
"introduce new ``make dtbs_check W=1`` warnings.  Warnings in a new board "
"DTS, which are results of issues in an included DTSI file, are considered "
"existing, not new warnings.  For series split between different trees (DT "
"bindings go via driver subsystem tree), warnings on linux-next are "
"decisive.  The platform maintainers have automation in place which should "
"point out any new warnings."

"If a commit introducing new warnings gets accepted somehow, the resulting "
"issues shall be fixed in reasonable time (e.g. within one release) or the "
