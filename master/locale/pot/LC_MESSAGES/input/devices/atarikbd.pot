"The Atari Corp. Intelligent Keyboard (ikbd) is a general purpose keyboard "
"controller that is flexible enough that it can be used in a variety of "
"products without modification. The keyboard, with its microcontroller, "
"provides a convenient connection point for a mouse and switch-type "
"joysticks. The ikbd processor also maintains a time-of-day clock with one "
"second resolution. The ikbd has been designed to be general enough that it "
"can be used with a variety of new computer products. Product variations in a "
"number of keyswitches, mouse resolution, etc. can be accommodated. The ikbd "
"communicates with the main processor over a high speed bi-directional serial "
"interface. It can function in a variety of modes to facilitate different "
"applications of the keyboard,  joysticks, or mouse. Limited use of the "
"controller is possible in applications in which only a unidirectional "
"communications medium is available by carefully designing the default modes."

"The keyboard always returns key make/break scan codes. The ikbd generates "
"keyboard scan codes for each key press and release. The key scan make (key "
"closure) codes start at 1, and are defined in Appendix A. For example, the "
"ISO key position in the scan code table should exist even if no keyswitch "
"exists in that position on a particular keyboard. The break code for each "
"key is obtained by ORing 0x80 with the make code."
