"This driver provides support for N-Trig pen and multi-touch sensors.  Single "
"and multi-touch events are translated to the appropriate protocols for the "
"hid and input systems.  Pen events are sufficiently hid compliant and are "
"left to the hid core.  The driver also provides additional filtering and "
"utility functions accessible with sysfs and module parameters."

"With the release of the early multi-touch firmwares it became increasingly "
"obvious that these sensors were prone to erroneous events.  Users reported "
"seeing both inappropriately dropped contact and ghosts, contacts reported "
"where no finger was actually touching the screen."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Deactivation slack helps prevent dropped contact for single touch use, but "
"does not address the problem of dropping one of more contacts while other "
"contacts are still active.  Drops in the multi-touch context require "
"additional processing and should be handled in tandem with tacking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As observed ghost contacts are similar to actual use of the sensor, but they "
"seem to have different profiles.  Ghost activity typically shows up as small "
"short lived touches.  As such, I assume that the longer the continuous "
"stream of events the more likely those events are from a real contact, and "
"that the larger the size of each contact the more likely it is real.  "
"Balancing the goals of preventing ghosts and accepting real events quickly "
"(to minimize user observable latency), the filter accumulates confidence for "
"incoming events until it hits thresholds and begins propagating.  In the "
"interest in minimizing stored state as well as the cost of operations to "
"make a decision, I've kept that decision simple."

"Time is measured in terms of the number of fingers reported, not frames "
"since the probability of multiple simultaneous ghosts is expected to drop "
"off dramatically with increasing numbers.  Rather than accumulate weight as "
"a function of size, I just use it as a binary threshold.  A sufficiently "
"large contact immediately overrides the waiting period and leads to "
"activation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../input/devices/ntrig.rst:103
msgid ""
"Setting the activation size thresholds to large values will result in "
"deciding primarily on activation slack.  If you see longer lived ghosts, "
"turning up the activation slack while reducing the size thresholds may "
"suffice to eliminate the ghosts while keeping the screen quite responsive to "
"firm taps."

msgid ""
"Contacts continue to be filtered with min_height and min_width even after "
"the initial activation filter is satisfied.  The intent is to provide a "
"mechanism for filtering out ghosts in the form of an extra finger while you "
"actually are using the screen.  In practice this sort of ghost has been far "
"less problematic or relatively rare and I've left the defaults set to 0 for "
"both parameters, effectively turning off that filter."
