"This document describes how to use force feedback devices under Linux. The "
"goal is not to support these devices as if they were simple input-only "
"devices (as it is already the case), but to really enable the rendering of "
"force effects. This document only describes the force feedback part of the "
"Linux input interface. Please read joydev/joystick.rst and input.rst before "
