"This driver provides support for the accelerometer found in various Toshiba "
"laptops, being called \"Toshiba HDD Protection - Shock Sensor\" officially, "
"and detects laptops automatically with this device. On Windows, Toshiba "
"provided software monitors this device and provides automatic HDD protection "
"(head unload) on sudden moves or harsh vibrations, however, this driver only "
"provides a notification via a sysfs file to let userspace tools or daemons "
"act accordingly, as well as providing a sysfs file to set the desired "
"protection level or sensor sensibility."
