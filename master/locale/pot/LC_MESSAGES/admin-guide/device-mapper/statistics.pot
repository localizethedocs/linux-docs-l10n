"Device Mapper supports the collection of I/O statistics on user-defined "
"regions of a DM device.  If no regions are defined no statistics are "
"collected so there isn't any performance impact.  Only bio-based DM devices "
"are currently supported."

"range specified."

"The I/O statistics counters for each step-sized area of a region are in the "
"same format as `/sys/block/*/stat` or `/proc/diskstats` (see: Documentation/"
"admin-guide/iostats.rst).  But two extra counters (12 and 13) are provided: "
"total time spent reading and writing.  When the histogram argument is used, "
"the 14th parameter is reported that represents the histogram of latencies.  "
"All these counters may be accessed by sending the @stats_print message to "
"the appropriate DM device via dmsetup."

"Each region has a corresponding unique identifier, which we call a "
