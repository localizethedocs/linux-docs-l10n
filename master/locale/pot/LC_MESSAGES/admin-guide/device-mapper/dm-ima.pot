"Device mapper plays a critical role on a given system by providing various "
"important functionalities to the block devices using various target types "
"like crypt, verity, integrity etc.  Each of these target typesâ€™ "
"functionalities can be configured with various attributes. The attributes "
"chosen to configure these target types can significantly impact the security "
"profile of the block device, and in-turn, of the system itself.  For "
"instance, the type of encryption algorithm and the key size determines the "
"strength of encryption for a given block device."
