"The cgroup freezer is useful to batch job management system which start and "
"stop sets of tasks in order to schedule the resources of a machine according "
"to the desires of a system administrator. This sort of program is often used "
"on HPC clusters to schedule access to the cluster as a whole. The cgroup "
"freezer uses cgroups to describe the set of tasks to be started/stopped by "
"the batch job management system. It also provides a means to start and stop "
"the tasks composing the job."

"The cgroup freezer will also be useful for checkpointing running groups of "
"tasks. The freezer allows the checkpoint code to obtain a consistent image "
"of the tasks by attempting to force the tasks in a cgroup into a quiescent "
"state. Once the tasks are quiescent another task can walk /proc or invoke a "
"kernel interface to gather information about the quiesced tasks. "
"Checkpointed tasks can be restarted later should a recoverable error occur. "
"This also allows the checkpointed tasks to be migrated between nodes in a "
"cluster by copying the gathered information to another node and restarting "
"the tasks there."

"Sequences of SIGSTOP and SIGCONT are not always sufficient for stopping and "
"resuming tasks in userspace. Both of these signals are observable from "
"within the tasks we wish to freeze. While SIGSTOP cannot be caught, blocked, "
"or ignored it can be seen by waiting or ptracing parent tasks. SIGCONT is "
"especially unsuitable since it can be caught by the task. Any programs "
"designed to watch for SIGSTOP and SIGCONT could be broken by attempting to "
"use SIGSTOP and SIGCONT to stop and resume tasks. We can demonstrate this "
"problem using nested bash shells::"

"This happens because bash can observe both signals and choose how it "

"Another example of a program which catches and responds to these signals is "
"gdb. In fact any program designed to use ptrace is likely to have a problem "
"with this method of stopping and resuming tasks."

"In contrast, the cgroup freezer uses the kernel freezer code to prevent the "
"freeze/unfreeze cycle from becoming visible to the tasks being frozen. This "

"The cgroup freezer is hierarchical. Freezing a cgroup freezes all tasks "
