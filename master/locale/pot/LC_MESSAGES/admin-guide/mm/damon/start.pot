"For the demonstration, we will use the default user space tool for DAMON, "

"damonitor/damo.  The examples below assume that ``damo`` is on your "

"The first command of the above example downloads and builds an artificial "

"DAMO to start the program via the given command and make DAMON monitors the "

"in a human readable format."

"The first line of the output shows the relative access temperature (hotness) "

"represents regions of same size on the monitored virtual address space.  The "
"position of the colun on the row and the number on the column represents the "
"relative location and access temperature of the region.  ``[...]`` means "
"unmapped huge regions on the virtual address spaces.  The second line shows "
