"The kernel keeps a table of released microcode. Systems that had microcode "
"older than this at boot will say \"Vulnerable\".  This means that the system "
"was vulnerable to some known CPU issue. It could be security or functional, "
"the kernel does not know or care."

"You should update the CPU microcode to mitigate any exposure. This is "
"usually accomplished by updating the files in /lib/firmware/intel-ucode/ via "
"normal distribution updates. Intel also distributes these files in a github "
"repo:"
