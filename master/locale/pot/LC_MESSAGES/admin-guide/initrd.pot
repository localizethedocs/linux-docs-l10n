msgid ""
"The main motivation for implementing initrd was to allow for modular kernel "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/initrd.rst:279
msgid ""
"system boots from floppy or other media with a minimal kernel (e.g. support "
"for RAM disks, initrd, a.out, and the Ext2 FS) and loads initrd"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/initrd.rst:282
msgid ""
"``/sbin/init`` determines what is needed to (1) mount the \"real\" root FS "
"(i.e. device type, device drivers, file system) and (2) the distribution "
"media (e.g. CD-ROM, network, tape, ...). This can be done by asking the "
"user, by auto-probing, or by using a hybrid approach."

"to be a very usable system yet)"

#: ../../../admin-guide/initrd.rst:290

"``/sbin/init`` invokes ``pivot_root`` to change the root file system and "
"execs - via chroot - a program that continues the installation"

msgid "the boot loader is installed"

#: ../../../admin-guide/initrd.rst:293
msgid ""
"the boot loader is configured to load an initrd with the set of modules that "

"normal system operation without requiring the use of a bloated \"generic\" "
"kernel or re-compiling or re-linking the kernel."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/initrd.rst:304
msgid ""
"A second scenario is for installations where Linux runs on systems with "
"different hardware configurations in a single administrative domain. In such "
"cases, it is desirable to generate only a small set of kernels (ideally only "
"one) and to keep the system-specific part of configuration information as "
"small as possible. In this case, a common initrd could be generated with all "
"the necessary modules. Then, only ``/sbin/init`` or a file read by it would "
"have to be different."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/initrd.rst:312
msgid ""
"A third scenario is more convenient recovery disks, because information like "
"the location of the root FS partition doesn't have to be provided at boot "
"time, but the system loaded from initrd can invoke a user-friendly dialog "
"and it can also perform some sanity checks (or even some form of auto-"
"detection)."

"Last not least, CD-ROM distributors may use it for better installation from "
"CD, e.g. by using a boot floppy and bootstrapping a bigger RAM disk via "
