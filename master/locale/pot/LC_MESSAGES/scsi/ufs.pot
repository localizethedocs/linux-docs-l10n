"Universal Flash Storage (UFS) is a storage specification for flash devices. "
"It aims to provide a universal storage interface for both embedded and "
"removable flash memory-based storage in mobile devices such as smart phones "
"and tablet computers. The specification is defined by JEDEC Solid State "
"Technology Association. UFS is based on the MIPI M-PHY physical layer "
"standard. UFS uses MIPI M-PHY as the physical layer and MIPI Unipro as the "
"link layer."
