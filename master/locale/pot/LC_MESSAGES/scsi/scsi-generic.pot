"The SCSI Generic driver (sg) is one of the four \"high level\" SCSI device "
"drivers along with sd, st and sr (disk, tape and CD-ROM respectively). Sg is "
"more generalized (but lower level) than its siblings and tends to be used on "
"SCSI devices that don't fit into the already serviced categories. Thus sg is "
"used for scanners, CD writers and reading audio CDs digitally amongst other "
"things."
