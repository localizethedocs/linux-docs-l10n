"The **rtla timerlat** tool is an interface for the *timerlat* tracer. The "
"*timerlat* tracer dispatches a kernel thread per-cpu. These threads set a "
"periodic timer to wake themselves up and go back to sleep. After the wakeup, "
"they collect and generate useful information for the debugging of operating "
"system timer latency."

"The *timerlat* tracer outputs information in two ways. It periodically "
"prints the timer latency at the timer *IRQ* handler and the *Thread* "
"handler. It also enables the trace of the most relevant information via "
"**osnoise:** tracepoints."

"The **rtla timerlat** tool sets the options of the *timerlat* tracer and "
"collects and displays a summary of the results. By default, the collection "
"is done synchronously in kernel space using a dedicated BPF program attached "
"to the *timerlat* tracer. If either BPF or the **osnoise:timerlat_sample** "
"tracepoint it attaches to is unavailable, the **rtla timerlat** tool falls "
"back to using tracefs to process the data asynchronously in user space."
