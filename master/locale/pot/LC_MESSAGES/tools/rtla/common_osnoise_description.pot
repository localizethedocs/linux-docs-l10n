"The **rtla osnoise** tool is an interface for the *osnoise* tracer. The "
"*osnoise* tracer dispatches a kernel thread per-cpu. These threads read the "
"time in a loop while with preemption, softirq and IRQs enabled, thus "
"allowing all the sources of operating system noise during its execution. The "
"*osnoise*'s tracer threads take note of the delta between each time read, "
"along with an interference counter of all sources of interference. At the "
"end of each period, the *osnoise* tracer displays a summary of the results."
