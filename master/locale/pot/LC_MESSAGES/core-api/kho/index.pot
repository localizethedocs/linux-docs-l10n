msgid ""
"To boot into kexec, we need to have a physically contiguous memory range "
"that contains no handed over memory. Kexec then places the target kernel and "
"initrd into that region. The new kernel exclusively uses this region for "
"memory allocations before during boot up to the initialization of the page "
"allocator."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/kho/index.rst:53
msgid ""
"We guarantee that we always have such regions through the scratch regions: "
"On first boot KHO allocates several physically contiguous memory regions. "
"Since after kexec these regions will be used by early memory allocations, "
"there is a scratch region per NUMA node plus a scratch region to satisfy "
"allocations requests that do not require particular NUMA node assignment. By "
"default, size of the scratch region is calculated based on amount of memory "
"allocated during boot. The ``kho_scratch`` kernel command line option may be "
"used to explicitly define size of the scratch regions. The scratch regions "
"are declared as CMA when page allocator is initialized so that their memory "
"can be used during system lifetime. CMA gives us the guarantee that no "
"handover pages land in that region, because handover pages must be at a "
"static physical memory location and CMA enforces that only movable pages can "
"be located inside."

"After KHO kexec, we ignore the ``kho_scratch`` kernel command line option "
"and instead reuse the exact same region that was originally allocated. This "
"allows us to recursively execute any amount of KHO kexecs. Because we used "
"this region for boot memory allocations and as target memory for kexec "
"blobs, some parts of that memory region may be reserved. These reservations "
"are irrelevant for the next KHO, because kexec can overwrite even the "
"original kernel."

"To enable user space based kexec file loader, the kernel needs to be able to "
"provide the FDT that describes the current kernel's state before performing "
"the actual kexec. The process of generating that FDT is called "
"serialization. When the FDT is generated, some properties of the system may "
"become immutable because they are already written down in the FDT. That "
"state is called the KHO finalization phase."
