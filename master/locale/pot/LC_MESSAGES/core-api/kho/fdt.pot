"KHO uses the flattened device tree (FDT) container format and libfdt library "
"to create and parse the data that is passed between the kernels. The "
"properties in KHO FDT are stored in native format. It includes the physical "
"address of an in-memory structure describing all preserved memory regions, "
"as well as physical addresses of KHO users' own FDTs. Interpreting those sub "
"FDTs is the responsibility of KHO users."

"KHO saves a special property named ``preserved-memory-map`` under the root "

"The ``compatible`` property determines compatibility between the kernel that "
"created the KHO FDT and the kernel that attempts to load it. If the kernel "
"that loads the KHO FDT is not compatible with it, the entire KHO process "
"will be bypassed."

"Generally, a KHO user serialize its state into its own FDT and instructs KHO "

"recover its state from the preserved FDT."
