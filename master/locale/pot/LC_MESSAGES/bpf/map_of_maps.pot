"``BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY_OF_MAPS`` and ``BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH_OF_MAPS`` were "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../bpf/map_of_maps.rst:12
msgid ""
"``BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY_OF_MAPS`` and ``BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH_OF_MAPS`` provide "
"general purpose support for map in map storage. One level of nesting is "
"supported, where an outer map contains instances of a single type of inner "
"map, for example ``array_of_maps->sock_map``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bpf/map_of_maps.rst:17
msgid ""
"When creating an outer map, an inner map instance is used to initialize the "
"metadata that the outer map holds about its inner maps. This inner map has a "
"separate lifetime from the outer map and can be deleted after the outer map "
"has been created."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bpf/map_of_maps.rst:22
msgid ""
"The outer map supports element lookup, update and delete from user space "
"using the syscall API. A BPF program is only allowed to do element lookup in "
"the outer map."

"For ``BPF_MAP_TYPE_ARRAY_OF_MAPS`` the key is an unsigned 32-bit integer "
"index into the array. The array is a fixed size with ``max_entries`` "
"elements that are zero initialized when created."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bpf/map_of_maps.rst:36
msgid ""
"For ``BPF_MAP_TYPE_HASH_OF_MAPS`` the key type can be chosen when defining "
"the map. The kernel is responsible for allocating and freeing key/value "
"pairs, up to the max_entries limit that you specify. Hash maps use pre-"
"allocation of hash table elements by default. The ``BPF_F_NO_PREALLOC`` flag "
"can be used to disable pre-allocation when it is too memory expensive."
