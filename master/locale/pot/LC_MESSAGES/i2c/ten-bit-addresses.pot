"The I2C protocol knows about two kinds of device addresses: normal 7 bit "
"addresses, and an extended set of 10 bit addresses. The sets of addresses do "
"not intersect: the 7 bit address 0x10 is not the same as the 10 bit address "
"0x10 (though a single device could respond to both of them). To avoid "
"ambiguity, the user sees 10 bit addresses mapped to a different address "
"space, namely 0xa000-0xa3ff. The leading 0xa (= 10) represents the 10 bit "
"mode. This is used for creating device names in sysfs. It is also needed "
"when instantiating 10 bit devices via the new_device file in sysfs."

"Not all bus drivers support 10-bit addresses. Some don't because the "
"hardware doesn't support them (SMBus doesn't require 10-bit address support "
"for example), some don't because nobody bothered adding the code (or it's "
"there but not working properly.) Software implementation (i2c-algo-bit) is "
"known to work."

"Note that 10-bit address devices are still pretty rare, so the limitations "
