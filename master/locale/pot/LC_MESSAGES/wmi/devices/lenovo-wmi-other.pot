"The Other Mode WMI interface uses the firmware_attributes class to expose "

"attribute exposed by the Other Mode interface has corresponding capability "
"data blocks which allow the driver to probe details about the attribute. "
"Each attribute has multiple pages, one for each of the platform profiles "
