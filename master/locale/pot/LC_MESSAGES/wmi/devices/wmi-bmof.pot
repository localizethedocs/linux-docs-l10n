"Many machines embed WMI Binary MOF (Managed Object Format) metadata used to "
"describe the details of their ACPI WMI interfaces. The data can be decoded "
"with tools like `bmfdec <https://github.com/pali/bmfdec>`_ to obtain a human "
"readable WMI interface description, which is useful for developing new WMI "
"drivers."

"The Binary MOF data can be retrieved from the ``bmof`` sysfs attribute of "

"The Binary MOF WMI device is identified by the WMI GUID ``05901221-D566-11D1-"
"B2F0-00A0C9062910``. The Binary MOF can be obtained by doing a WMI data "
"block query. The result is then returned as an ACPI buffer with a variable "
"size."
