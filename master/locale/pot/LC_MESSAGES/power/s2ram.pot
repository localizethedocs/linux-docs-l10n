"I've been working at making the machines I have able to STR, and almost "
"always it's a driver that is buggy. Thank God for the suspend/resume "
"debugging - the thing that Chuck tried to disable. That's often the _only_ "
"way to debug these things, and it's actually pretty powerful (but time-"
"consuming - having to insert TRACE_RESUME() markers into the device driver "
"that doesn't resume and recompile and reboot)."

"which means that the last trace event was just before trying to resume "

"For example, the above happens to be the VGA device on my EVO, which I used "
"to run with \"radeonfb\" (it's an ATI Radeon mobility). It turns out that "
"\"radeonfb\" simply cannot resume that device - it tries to set the PLL's, "

"pm_trace uses the system's Real Time Clock (RTC) to save the magic number. "

"pm_trace is not compatible with asynchronous suspend, so it turns "

"Consequence is that after a resume (even if it is successful) your system "
"clock will have a value corresponding to the magic number instead of the "
"correct date/time! It is therefore advisable to use a program like ntp-date "
"or rdate to reset the correct date/time from an external time source when "
"using this trace option."

"As the clock keeps ticking it is also essential that the reboot is done "
"quickly after the resume failure. The trace option does not use the seconds "
"or the low order bits of the minutes of the RTC, but a too long delay will "
"corrupt the magic value."
