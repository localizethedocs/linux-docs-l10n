"Text mode is supported even in higher resolutions, but there is limitation "
"to lower pixclocks (i got maximum about 70 MHz, it is dependent on specific "
"hardware). This limitation is not enforced by driver. Text mode supports "
"8bit wide fonts only (hardware limitation) and 16bit tall fonts (driver "
"limitation). Unfortunately character attributes (like color) in text mode "
"are broken for unknown reason, so its usefulness is limited."
