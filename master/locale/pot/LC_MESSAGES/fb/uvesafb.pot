"uvesafb should work with any video card that has a Video BIOS compliant with "
"the VBE 2.0 standard."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../fb/uvesafb.rst:11
msgid ""
"Unlike other drivers, uvesafb makes use of a userspace helper called v86d.  "
"v86d is used to run the x86 Video BIOS code in a simulated and controlled "
"environment.  This allows uvesafb to function on arches other than x86.  "
"Check the v86d documentation for a list of currently supported arches."

msgid ""
"uvesafb is a _generic_ driver which supports a wide variety of video cards, "
"but which is ultimately limited by the Video BIOS interface. The most "
"important limitations are:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../fb/uvesafb.rst:36
msgid "Lack of any type of acceleration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../fb/uvesafb.rst:37
msgid ""
"A strict and limited set of supported video modes.  Often the native or most "
"optimal resolution/refresh rate for your setup will not work with uvesafb, "
"simply because the Video BIOS doesn't support the video mode you want to "
"use.  This can be especially painful with widescreen panels, where native "
"video modes don't have the 4:3 aspect ratio, which is what most BIOS-es are "
"limited to."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../fb/uvesafb.rst:43
msgid ""
"Adjusting the refresh rate is only possible with a VBE 3.0 compliant Video "
"BIOS.  Note that many nVidia Video BIOS-es claim to be VBE 3.0 compliant, "
"while they simply ignore any refresh rate settings."
