"The framebuffer console (fbcon), as its name implies, is a text console "
"running on top of the framebuffer device. It has the functionality of any "
"standard text console driver, such as the VGA console, with the added "
"features that can be attributed to the graphical nature of the framebuffer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../fb/fbcon.rst:10

"In the x86 architecture, the framebuffer console is optional, and some even "
"treat it as a toy. For other architectures, it is the only available display "
"device, text or graphical."

"What are the features of fbcon?  The framebuffer console supports high "
"resolutions, varying font types, display rotation, primitive multihead, etc. "
"Theoretically, multi-colored fonts, blending, aliasing, and any feature made "

"In order for fbcon to activate, at least one framebuffer driver is required, "
"so choose from any of the numerous drivers available. For x86 systems, they "
"almost universally have VGA cards, so vga16fb and vesafb will always be "
"available. However, using a chipset-specific driver will give you more speed "
