"The multicolor class groups monochrome LEDs and allows controlling two "
"aspects of the final combined color: hue and lightness. The former is "
"controlled via the multi_intensity array file and the latter is controlled "
"via brightness file."

"The multicolor class presents files that groups the colors as indexes in an "
"array.  These files are children under the LED parent node created by the "
"led_class framework.  The led_class framework is documented in led-class.rst "
"within this documentation directory."

"Each colored LED will be indexed under the ``multi_*`` files. The order of "
"the colors will be arbitrary. The ``multi_index`` file can be read to "
"determine the color name to indexed value."

"The ``multi_intensity`` is an array that can be read or written to for the "
