"Tracefs ring-buffer memory map provides an efficient method to stream data "
"as no memory copy is necessary. The application mapping the ring-buffer "
"becomes then a consumer for that ring-buffer, in a similar fashion to "
"trace_pipe."

"The first system page of the mapping contains ring-buffer statistics and "
"description. It is referred to as the meta-page. One of the most important "
"fields of the meta-page is the reader. It contains the sub-buffer ID which "
"can be safely read by the mapper (see ring-buffer-design.rst)."

#: ../../../trace/ring-buffer-map.rst:24
msgid ""
"The meta-page is followed by all the sub-buffers, ordered by ascending ID. "
"It is therefore effortless to know where the reader starts in the mapping:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/ring-buffer-map.rst:32
msgid ""
"When the application is done with the current reader, it can get a new one "
"using the trace_pipe_raw ioctl() TRACE_MMAP_IOCTL_GET_READER. This ioctl "
"also updates the meta-page fields."

msgid "Limitations"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/ring-buffer-map.rst:38
msgid ""
"When a mapping is in place on a Tracefs ring-buffer, it is not possible to "
"either resize it (either by increasing the entire size of the ring-buffer or "
"each subbuf). It is also not possible to use snapshot and causes splice to "
"copy the ring buffer data instead of using the copyless swap from the ring "
"buffer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/ring-buffer-map.rst:43
msgid ""
"Concurrent readers (either another application mapping that ring-buffer or "
"the kernel with trace_pipe) are allowed but not recommended. They will "
"compete for the ring-buffer and the output is unpredictable, just like "
"concurrent readers on trace_pipe would be."
