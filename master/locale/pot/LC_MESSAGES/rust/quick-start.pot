"There are a few ways to install a Rust toolchain needed for kernel "
"development. A simple way is to use the packages from your Linux "
"distribution if they are suitable -- the first section below explains this "
"approach. An advantage of this approach is that, typically, the distribution "
"will match the LLVM used by Rust and Clang."

#: ../../../rust/quick-start.rst:14

"Another way is using the prebuilt stable versions of LLVM+Rust provided on "
"`kernel.org <https://kernel.org/pub/tools/llvm/rust/>`_. These are the same "
"slim and fast LLVM toolchains from :ref:`Getting LLVM <getting_llvm>` with "
"versions of Rust added to them that Rust for Linux supports. Two sets are "
