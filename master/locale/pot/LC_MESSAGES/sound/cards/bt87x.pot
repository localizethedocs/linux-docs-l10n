"You might have noticed that the bt878 grabber cards have actually *two* PCI "
"functions: ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/cards/bt87x.rst:18
msgid ""
"The first does video, it is backward compatible to the bt848.  The second "
"does audio.  snd-bt87x is a driver for the second function.  It's a sound "
"driver which can be used for recording sound (and *only* recording, no "
"playback).  As most TV cards come with a short cable which can be plugged "
"into your sound card's line-in you probably don't need this driver if all "
"you want to do is just watching TV..."

"Some cards do not bother to connect anything to the audio input pins of the "
"chip, and some other cards use the audio function to transport MPEG video "
"data, so it's quite possible that audio recording may not work with your "
"card."

"The driver is now stable.  However, it doesn't know about many TV cards, and "
"it refuses to load for cards it doesn't know."

msgid ""
"If the driver complains (\"Unknown TV card found, the audio driver will not "
"load\"), you can specify the ``load_all=1`` option to force the driver to "
"try to use the audio capture function of your card.  If the frequency of "
"recorded data is not right, try to specify the ``digital_rate`` option with "
"other values than the default 32000 (often it's 44100 or 64000)."

"If you have an unknown card, please mail the ID and board name to <alsa-"

"The first device (hw:X,0) gives you 16 bit stereo sound.  The sample rate "

"The second device (hw:X,1) gives you 8 or 16 bit mono sound.  Supported "
"sample rates are between 119466 and 448000 Hz (yes, these numbers are that "
"high).  If you've set the CONFIG_SND_BT87X_OVERCLOCK option, the maximum "
"sample rate is 1792000 Hz, but audio data becomes unusable beyond 896000 Hz "
