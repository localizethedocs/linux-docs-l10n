"ACPI 5 introduced a set of new resources (UartTSerialBus, I2cSerialBus, "

"Devices behind real busses where there is a connector resource are "
"represented as struct spi_device or struct i2c_client. Note that standard "

"Since we are using platform devices to represent devices that are not "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../firmware-guide/acpi/enumeration.rst:70
msgid ""
"Generally speaking, there are two categories of devices in a system in which "
"ACPI is used as an interface between the platform firmware and the OS: "
"Devices that can be discovered and enumerated natively, through a protocol "
"defined for the specific bus that they are on (for example, configuration "
"space in PCI), without the platform firmware assistance, and devices that "
"need to be described by the platform firmware so that they can be "
"discovered.  Still, for any device known to the platform firmware, "
"regardless of which category it falls into, there can be a corresponding "
"ACPI device object in the ACPI Namespace in which case the Linux kernel will "
"create a struct acpi_device object based on it for that device."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../firmware-guide/acpi/enumeration.rst:81
msgid ""
"Those struct acpi_device objects are never used for binding drivers to "
"natively discoverable devices, because they are represented by other types "
"of device objects (for example, struct pci_dev for PCI devices) that are "
"bound to by device drivers (the corresponding struct acpi_device object is "
"then used as an additional source of information on the configuration of the "
"given device). Moreover, the core ACPI device enumeration code creates "
"struct platform_device objects for the majority of devices that are "
"discovered and enumerated with the help of the platform firmware and those "
"platform device objects can be bound to by platform drivers in direct "
"analogy with the natively enumerable devices case.  Therefore it is "
"logically inconsistent and so generally invalid to bind drivers to struct "
"acpi_device objects, including drivers for devices that are discovered with "
"the help of the platform firmware."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../firmware-guide/acpi/enumeration.rst:94
msgid ""
"Historically, ACPI drivers that bound directly to struct acpi_device objects "
"were implemented for some devices enumerated with the help of the platform "
"firmware, but this is not recommended for any new drivers.  As explained "
"above, platform device objects are created for those devices as a rule (with "
"a few exceptions that are not relevant here) and so platform drivers should "
"be used for handling them, even though the corresponding ACPI device objects "
"are the only source of device configuration information in that case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../firmware-guide/acpi/enumeration.rst:102
msgid ""
"For every device having a corresponding struct acpi_device object, the "
"pointer to it is returned by the ACPI_COMPANION() macro, so it is always "
"possible to get to the device configuration information stored in the ACPI "
"device object this way.  Accordingly, struct acpi_device can be regarded as "
"a part of the interface between the kernel and the ACPI Namespace, whereas "
"device objects of other types (for example, struct pci_dev or struct "
"platform_device) are used for interacting with the rest of the system."
