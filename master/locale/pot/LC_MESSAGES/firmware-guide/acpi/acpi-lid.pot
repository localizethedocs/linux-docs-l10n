"Platforms containing lids convey lid state (open/close) to OSPMs using a "
"control method lid device. To implement this, the AML tables issue "
"Notify(lid_device, 0x80) to notify the OSPMs whenever the lid state has "
"changed. The _LID control method for the lid device must be implemented to "
"report the \"current\" state of the lid as either \"opened\" or \"closed\"."

"For most platforms, both the _LID method and the lid notifications are "

"exceptions of the Linux ACPI lid device driver."

"The _LID control method is described to return the \"current\" lid state. "
"However the word of \"current\" has ambiguity, some buggy AML tables return "
"the lid state upon the last lid notification instead of returning the lid "
"state upon the last _LID evaluation. There won't be difference when the _LID "
"control method is evaluated during the runtime, the problem is its initial "
"returning value. When the AML tables implement this control method with "
"cached value, the initial returning value is likely not reliable. There are "
"platforms always return \"closed\" as initial lid state."

"There are buggy AML tables never notifying when the lid device state is "
"changed to \"opened\". Thus the \"opened\" notification is not guaranteed. "
"But it is guaranteed that the AML tables always notify \"closed\" when the "
"lid state is changed to \"closed\". The \"closed\" notification is normally "
"used to trigger some system power saving operations on Windows. Since it is "
"fully tested, it is reliable from all AML tables."
