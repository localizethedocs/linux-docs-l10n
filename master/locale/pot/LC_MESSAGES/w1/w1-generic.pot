msgid ""
"When a device is found on the bus, w1 core tries to load the driver for its "
"family and check if it is loaded. If so, the family driver is attached to "
"the slave. If there is no driver for the family, default one is assigned, "
"which allows to perform almost any kind of operations. Each logical "
"operation is a transaction in nature, which can contain several (two or one) "
"low-level operations. Let's see how one can read EEPROM context: 1. one must "
"write control buffer, i.e. buffer containing command byte and two byte "
"address. At this step bus is reset and appropriate device is selected using "
"either W1_SKIP_ROM or W1_MATCH_ROM command. Then provided control buffer is "
"being written to the wire. 2. reading. This will issue reading eeprom "
"response."
