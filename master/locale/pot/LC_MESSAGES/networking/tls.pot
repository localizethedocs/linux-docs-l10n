"Setting the TLS ULP allows us to set/get TLS socket options. Currently only "
"the symmetric encryption is handled in the kernel.  After the TLS handshake "
"is complete, we have all the parameters required to move the data-path to "
"the kernel. There is a separate socket option for moving the transmit and "
"the receive into the kernel."

"After setting the TLS_TX socket option all application data sent over this "

"option. For example, we can send an encrypted hello world record as follows:"
msgstr ""

"send() data is directly encrypted from the userspace buffer provided to the "
"encrypted kernel send buffer if possible."

#: ../../../networking/tls.rst:81

"The sendfile system call will send the file's data over TLS records of "
"maximum length (2^14)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/tls.rst:90
msgid ""
"TLS records are created and sent after each send() call, unless MSG_MORE is "
"passed.  MSG_MORE will delay creation of a record until MSG_MORE is not "
"passed, or the maximum record size is reached."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/tls.rst:94
msgid ""
"The kernel will need to allocate a buffer for the encrypted data. This "
"buffer is allocated at the time send() is called, such that either the "
"entire send() call will return -ENOMEM (or block waiting for memory), or the "
"encryption will always succeed.  If send() returns -ENOMEM and some data was "
"left on the socket buffer from a previous call using MSG_MORE, the MSG_MORE "

"Other than application data, TLS has control messages such as alert messages "
"(record type 21) and handshake messages (record type 22), etc. These "

"In TLS 1.3, KeyUpdate handshake messages signal that the sender is updating "

"TLS_TX and TLS_RX socket options, as for the initial keys. TLS version and "
"cipher cannot be changed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/tls.rst:214
msgid ""
"To prevent attempting to decrypt incoming records using the wrong key, "
"decryption will be paused when a KeyUpdate message is received by the "

"Any read occurring after the KeyUpdate has been read and before the new key "
"is provided will fail with EKEYEXPIRED. poll() will not report any read "
