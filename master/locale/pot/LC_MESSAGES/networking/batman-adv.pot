"Batman advanced is a new approach to wireless networking which does no "
"longer operate on the IP basis. Unlike the batman daemon, which exchanges "
"information using UDP packets and sets routing tables, batman-advanced "
"operates on ISO/OSI Layer 2 only and uses and routes (or better: bridges) "
"Ethernet Frames. It emulates a virtual network switch of all nodes "
"participating. Therefore all nodes appear to be link local, thus all higher "
"operating protocols won't be affected by any changes within the network. You "
"can run almost any protocol above batman advanced, prominent examples are: "
"IPv4, IPv6, DHCP, IPX."

"Batman advanced was implemented as a Linux kernel driver to reduce the "
"overhead to a minimum. It does not depend on any (other) network driver, and "
"can be used on wifi as well as ethernet lan, vpn, etc ... (anything with "
"ethernet-style layer 2)."

msgid ""
"To make use of your newly created mesh, batman advanced provides a new "
"interface \"bat0\" which you should use from this point on. All interfaces "
"added to batman advanced are not relevant any longer because batman handles "
"them for you. Basically, one \"hands over\" the data by using the batman "
"interface and batman will make sure it reaches its destination."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/batman-adv.rst:89

"The \"bat0\" interface can be used like any other regular interface. It "
"needs an IP address which can be either statically configured or dynamically "
"(by using DHCP or similar services)::"

"All error messages, warnings and information messages are sent to the kernel "
