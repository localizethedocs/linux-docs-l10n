"Setting SMC auto corking size: SMC auto corking is like TCP auto corking "
"from the application's perspective of view. When applications do consecutive "
"small write()/sendmsg() system calls, we try to coalesce these small writes "
"as much as possible, to lower total amount of CDC and RDMA Write been sent. "
"autocorking_size limits the maximum corked bytes that can be sent to the "
"under device in 1 single sending. If set to 0, the SMC auto corking is "
"disabled. Applications can still use TCP_CORK for optimal behavior when they "
"know how/when to uncork their sockets."
