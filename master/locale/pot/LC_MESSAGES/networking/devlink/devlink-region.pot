"``devlink`` regions enable access to driver defined address regions using "
"devlink."

"Each device can create and register its own supported address regions. The "
"region can then be accessed via the devlink region interface."

"Region snapshots are collected by the driver, and can be accessed via read "
"or dump commands. This allows future analysis on the created snapshots. "
"Regions may optionally support triggering snapshots on demand."

"Snapshot identifiers are scoped to the devlink instance, not a region. All "
"snapshots with the same snapshot id within a devlink instance correspond to "
"the same event."

"The major benefit to creating a region is to provide access to internal "
"address regions that are otherwise inaccessible to the user."

"Regions may also be used to provide an additional way to debug complex error "

"Regions may optionally support capturing a snapshot on demand via the "
"``DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_NEW`` netlink message. A driver wishing to allow "
"requested snapshots must implement the ``.snapshot`` callback for the region "
"in its ``devlink_region_ops`` structure. If snapshot id is not set in the "
"``DEVLINK_CMD_REGION_NEW`` request kernel will allocate one and send the "
"snapshot information to user space."

#: ../../../networking/devlink/devlink-region.rst:34
msgid ""
"Regions may optionally allow directly reading from their contents without a "
"snapshot. Direct read requests are not atomic. In particular a read request "
"of size 256 bytes or larger will be split into multiple chunks. If atomic "
"access is required, use a snapshot. A driver wishing to enable this for a "
"region should implement the ``.read`` callback in the ``devlink_region_ops`` "
"structure. User space can request a direct read by using the "
"``DEVLINK_ATTR_REGION_DIRECT`` attribute instead of specifying a snapshot id."

"As regions are likely very device or driver specific, no generic regions are "
