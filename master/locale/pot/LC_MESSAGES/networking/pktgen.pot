"A larger TX ring can improve pktgen's performance, while it can hurt in the "
"general case, 1) because the TX ring buffer might get larger than the CPU's "
"L1/L2 cache, 2) because it allows more queueing in the NIC HW layer (which "
"is bad for bufferbloat)."

"One should hesitate to conclude that packets/descriptors in the HW TX ring "
