"mac80211_hwsim is a Linux kernel module that can be used to simulate "
"arbitrary number of IEEE 802.11 radios for mac80211. It can be used to test "
"most of the mac80211 functionality and user space tools (e.g., hostapd and "
"wpa_supplicant) in a way that matches very closely with the normal case of "
"using real WLAN hardware. From the mac80211 view point, mac80211_hwsim is "
"yet another hardware driver, i.e., no changes to mac80211 are needed to use "
"this testing tool."

"The main goal for mac80211_hwsim is to make it easier for developers to test "
"their code and work with new features to mac80211, hostapd, and "
"wpa_supplicant. The simulated radios do not have the limitations of real "
"hardware, so it is easy to generate an arbitrary test setup and always "
"reproduce the same setup for future tests. In addition, since all radio "
"operation is simulated, any channel can be used in tests regardless of "
"regulatory rules."

"mac80211_hwsim kernel module has a parameter 'radios' that can be used to "
"select how many radios are simulated (default 2). This allows configuration "
"of both very simply setups (e.g., just a single access point and a station) "
"or large scale tests (multiple access points with hundreds of stations)."

"mac80211_hwsim works by tracking the current channel of each virtual radio "
"and copying all transmitted frames to all other radios that are currently "
"enabled and on the same channel as the transmitting radio. Software "
"encryption in mac80211 is used so that the frames are actually encrypted "
"over the virtual air interface to allow more complete testing of encryption."

"A global monitoring netdev, hwsim#, is created independent of mac80211. This "

"This example shows how to use mac80211_hwsim to simulate two radios: one to "
"act as an access point and the other as a station that associates with the "
"AP. hostapd and wpa_supplicant are used to take care of WPA2-PSK "
"authentication. In addition, hostapd is also processing access point side of "
"association."
