"The old SR-IOV API is implemented in ``rtnetlink`` Netlink family as part of "
"the ``RTM_GETLINK`` and ``RTM_SETLINK`` commands. On the driver side it "
"consists of a number of ``ndo_set_vf_*`` and ``ndo_get_vf_*`` callbacks."

"Since the legacy APIs do not integrate well with the rest of the stack the "
"API is considered frozen; no new functionality or extensions will be "
"accepted. New drivers should not implement the uncommon callbacks; namely "
"the following callbacks are off limits:"
