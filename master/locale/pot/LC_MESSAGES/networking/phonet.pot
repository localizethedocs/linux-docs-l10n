"Phonet is a packet protocol used by Nokia cellular modems for both IPC and "
"RPC. With the Linux Phonet socket family, Linux host processes can receive "
"and send messages from/to the modem, or any other external device attached "
"to the modem. The modem takes care of routing."

"On Linux, the link-layer header includes the pn_media byte (see below). The "

#: ../../../networking/phonet.rst:44
msgid ""
"The device ID is split: the 6 higher-order bits constitute the device "
"address, while the 2 lower-order bits are used for multiplexing, as are the "
"8-bit object identifiers. As such, Phonet can be considered as a network "
"layer with 6 bits of address space and 10 bits for transport protocol (much "
"like port numbers in IP world)."

msgid ""
"Phonet links are always point-to-point links. The link layer header consists "
"of a single Phonet media type byte. It uniquely identifies the link through "
"which the packet is transmitted, from the modem's perspective. Each Phonet "
"network device shall prepend and set the media type byte as appropriate. For "
"convenience, a common phonet_header_ops link-layer header operations "
"structure is provided. It sets the media type according to the network "
"device hardware address."

"Linux Phonet network interfaces support a dedicated link layer packets type "
"(ETH_P_PHONET) which is out of the Ethernet type range. They can only send "
"and receive Phonet packets."

msgid ""
"The virtual TUN tunnel device driver can also be used for Phonet. This "
"requires IFF_TUN mode, _without_ the IFF_NO_PI flag. In this case, there is "
"no link-layer header, so there is no Phonet media type byte."

"The Phonet Pipe protocol is a simple sequenced packets protocol with end-to-"
