"The ``pds_vdpa`` driver is an auxiliary bus driver that supplies a vDPA "
"device for use by the virtio network stack.  It is used with the Pensando "
"Virtual Function devices that offer vDPA and virtio queue services.  It "
"depends on the ``pds_core`` driver and hardware for the PF and VF PCI "
"handling as well as for device configuration services."
