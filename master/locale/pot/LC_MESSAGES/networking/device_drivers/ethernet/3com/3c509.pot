#: ../../../networking/device_drivers/ethernet/3com/3c509.rst:69
msgid ""
"(a) You must have a Etherlink III card model whose hardware supports full- "
"duplex operations. Currently, the only members of the 3c509 family that are "
"positively known to support full-duplex are the 3c509B (ISA bus) and 3c589B "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/device_drivers/ethernet/3com/3c509.rst:76
msgid ""
"(b) You must be using your card's 10baseT transceiver (i.e., the RJ-45 "
"connector), not its AUI (thick-net) or 10base2 (thin-net/coax) interfaces. "
"AUI and 10base2 network cabling is physically incapable of full-duplex "
"operation."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/device_drivers/ethernet/3com/3c509.rst:81
msgid ""
"(c) Most importantly, your 3c509B must be connected to a link partner that "
"is itself full-duplex capable. This is almost certainly one of two things: a "
"full- duplex-capable  Ethernet switch (*not* a hub), or a full-duplex-"
"capable NIC on another system that's connected directly to the 3c509B via a "
"crossover cable."

"Understand that the 3c509B's hardware's full-duplex support is much more "
"limited than that provide by more modern network interface cards. Although "
"at the physical layer of the network it fully supports full-duplex "
"operation, the card was designed before the current Ethernet auto-"
"negotiation (N-way) spec was written. This means that the 3c509B family "
"***cannot and will not auto-negotiate a full-duplex connection with its link "
"partner under any circumstances, no matter how it is initialized***. If the "
"full-duplex mode of the 3c509B is enabled, its link partner will very likely "
"need to be independently _forced_ into full-duplex mode as well; otherwise "
"various nasty failures will occur - at the very least, you'll see massive "
"numbers of packet collisions. This is one of very rare circumstances where "
"disabling auto- negotiation and forcing the duplex mode of a network "
"interface card or switch would ever be necessary or desirable."
