"By default the DPAA Ethernet driver enables RSS, making use of the DPAA FMan "
"Parser and Keygen blocks to distribute traffic on 128 hardware frame queues "
"using a hash on IP v4/v6 source and destination and L4 source and "
"destination ports, in present in the received frame. When RSS is disabled, "
"all traffic received by a certain interface is received on the default Rx "
"frame queue. The default DPAA Rx frame queues are configured to put the "
"received traffic into a pool channel that allows any available CPU portal to "
"dequeue the ingress traffic. The default frame queues have the HOLDACTIVE "
"option set, ensuring that traffic bursts from a certain queue are serviced "
"by the same CPU. This ensures a very low rate of frame reordering. A "
"drawback of this is that only one CPU at a time can service the traffic "
"received by a certain interface when RSS is not enabled."

"To implement RSS, the DPAA Ethernet driver allocates an extra set of 128 Rx "
"frame queues that are configured to dedicated channels, in a round-robin "
"manner. The mapping of the frame queues to CPUs is now hardcoded, there is "
"no indirection table to move traffic for a certain FQ (hash result) to "
"another CPU. The ingress traffic arriving on one of these frame queues will "
"arrive at the same portal and will always be processed by the same CPU. This "
