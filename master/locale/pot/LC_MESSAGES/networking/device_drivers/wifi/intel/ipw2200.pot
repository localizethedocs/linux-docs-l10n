"Intel wireless LAN adapters are engineered, manufactured, tested, and "
"quality checked to ensure that they meet all necessary local and "
"governmental regulatory agency requirements for the regions that they are "
"designated and/or marked to ship into. Since wireless LANs are generally "
"unlicensed devices that share spectrum with radars, satellites, and other "
"licensed and unlicensed devices, it is sometimes necessary to dynamically "
"detect, avoid, and limit usage to avoid interference with these devices. In "
"many instances Intel is required to provide test data to prove regional and "
"local compliance to regional and governmental regulations before "
"certification or approval to use the product is granted. Intel's wireless "
"LAN's EEPROM, firmware, and software driver are designed to carefully "
"control parameters that affect radio operation and to ensure electromagnetic "
"compliance (EMC). These parameters include, without limitation, RF power, "
"spectrum usage, channel scanning, and human exposure."

"For these reasons Intel cannot permit any manipulation by third parties of "

"utilities, or code with the Intel wireless LAN adapters that have been "
"manipulated by an unauthorized party (i.e., patches, utilities, or code "
"(including open source code modifications) which have not been validated by "
"Intel), (i) you will be solely responsible for ensuring the regulatory "
"compliance of the products, (ii) Intel will bear no liability, under any "
"theory of liability for any issues associated with the modified products, "
"including without limitation, claims under the warranty and/or issues "
"arising from regulatory non-compliance, and (iii) Intel will not provide or "
