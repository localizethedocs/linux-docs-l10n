"This driver implements support for the Renesas HS3001 chips, a humidity and "
"temperature family. Temperature is measured in degrees celsius, relative "
"humidity is expressed as a percentage. In the sysfs interface, all values "
"are scaled by 1000, i.e. the value for 31.5 degrees celsius is 31500."
