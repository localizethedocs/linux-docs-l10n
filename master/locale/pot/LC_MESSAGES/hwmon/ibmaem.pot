msgid ""
"This driver implements sensor reading support for the energy and power "
"meters available on various IBM System X hardware through the BMC.  All "
"sensor banks will be exported as platform devices; this driver can talk to "
"both v1 and v2 interfaces.  This driver is completely separate from the "
"older ibmpex driver."

msgid ""
"The v1 AEM interface has a simple set of features to monitor energy use.  "
"There is a register that displays an estimate of raw energy consumption "
"since the last BMC reset, and a power sensor that returns average power use "
"over a configurable interval."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/ibmaem.rst:36
msgid ""
"The v2 AEM interface is a bit more sophisticated, being able to present a "
"wider range of energy and power use registers, the power cap as set by the "
"AEM software, and temperature sensors."

"The \"power_cap\" value displays the current system power cap, as set by the "
