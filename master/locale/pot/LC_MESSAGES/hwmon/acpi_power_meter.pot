"This driver implements sensor reading support for the power meters exposed "
"in the ACPI 4.0 spec (Chapter 10.4).  These devices have a simple set of "
"features--a power meter that returns average power use over a configurable "
"interval, an optional capping mechanism, and a couple of trip points.  The "
"sysfs interface conforms with the specification outlined in the \"Power\" "
"section of Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface.rst."

"The `power[1-*]_is_battery` knob indicates if the power supply is a battery. "
"Both `power[1-*]_average_{min,max}` must be set before the trip points will "
"work. When both of them are set, an ACPI event will be broadcast on the ACPI "
"netlink socket and a poll notification will be sent to the appropriate "
"`power[1-*]_average` sysfs file."

"The `power[1-*]_{model_number, serial_number, oem_info}` fields display "

"Some computers have the ability to enforce a power cap in hardware.  If this "
"is the case, the `power[1-*]_cap` and related sysfs files will appear. For "
"information on enabling the power cap feature, refer to the description of "
"the \"force_on_cap\" option in the \"Module Parameters\" chapter. To use the "
"power cap feature properly, you need to set appropriate value (in "
"microWatts) to the `power[1-*]_cap` sysfs files. The value must be within "
"the range between the minimum value at `power[1-]_cap_min` and the maximum "
"value at `power[1-]_cap_max (both in microWatts)`."

"When the average power consumption exceeds the cap, an ACPI event will be "
"broadcast on the netlink event socket and a poll notification will be sent "
"to the appropriate `power[1-*]_alarm` file to indicate that capping has "
"begun, and the hardware has taken action to reduce power consumption.  Most "
"likely this will result in reduced performance."

"There are a few other ACPI notifications that can be sent by the firmware.  "
"In all cases the ACPI event will be broadcast on the ACPI netlink event "
"socket as well as sent as a poll notification to a sysfs file.  The events "
"are as follows:"
