"If you want to set a pwm fan to manual mode, you just need to make sure it "

"Each temperature channel can control all the 8 PWM outputs (by setting the "
"corresponding bit in tempX_fan_map), you can set the temperature channel "
"mode using temp[1-6]_pwm_enable, 2 is Thermal Cruise mode and 3 is the "
"SmartFanII mode. Temperature channels will try to speed up or slow down all "
"controlled fans, this means one fan can receive different PWM value requests "

"In Thermal Cruise mode, the chip attempts to keep the temperature at a "

"SmartFanII works differently, you have to define up to 7 PWM, temperature "
