"This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor LM70 "
"temperature sensor."

msgid ""
"The LM70 temperature sensor chip supports a single temperature sensor. It "
"communicates with a host processor (or microcontroller) via an SPI/Microwire "
"Bus interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm70.rst:44
msgid ""
"Communication with the LM70 is simple: when the temperature is to be sensed, "
"the driver accesses the LM70 using SPI communication: 16 SCLK cycles "
"comprise the MOSI/MISO loop. At the end of the transfer, the 11-bit 2's "
"complement digital temperature (sent via the SIO line), is available in the "
"driver for interpretation. This driver makes use of the kernel's in-core SPI "
"support."

"As a real (in-tree) example of this \"SPI protocol driver\" interfacing with "

"The LM74 and TMP121/TMP122/TMP123/TMP124 are very similar; main difference "
