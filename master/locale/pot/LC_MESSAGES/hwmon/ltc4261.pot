"This driver does not probe for LTC4261 devices, since there is no register "

"Voltage readings provided by this driver are reported as obtained from the "
"ADC registers. If a set of voltage divider resistors is installed, calculate "
"the real voltage by multiplying the reported value with (R1+R2)/R2, where R1 "
"is the value of the divider resistor against the measured voltage and R2 is "
"the value of the divider resistor against Ground."

"Current reading provided by this driver is reported as obtained from the ADC "
"Current Sense register. The reported value assumes that a 1 mOhm sense "
"resistor is installed. If a different sense resistor is installed, calculate "

"in mOhm."

"The chip has two voltage sensors, but only one set of voltage alarm status "
"bits. In many many designs, those alarms are associated with the ADIN2 "
"sensor, due to the proximity of the ADIN2 pin to the OV pin. ADIN2 is, "
"however, not available on all chip variants. To ensure that the alarm "
"condition is reported to the user, report it with both voltage sensors."
