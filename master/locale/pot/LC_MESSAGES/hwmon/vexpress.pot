"Versatile Express platform (http://www.arm.com/versatileexpress/) is a "
"reference & prototyping system for ARM Ltd. processors. It can be set up "
"from a wide range of boards, each of them containing (apart of the main chip/"
"FPGA) a number of microcontrollers responsible for platform configuration "
"and control. These microcontrollers can also monitor the board and its "
"environment by a number of internal and external sensors, providing "
"information about power lines voltages and currents, board temperature and "
"power usage. Some of them also calculate consumed energy and provide a "
"cumulative use counter."
