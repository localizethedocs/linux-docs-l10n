"This driver implements support for the Texas Instruments ADC128D818. It is "
"described as 'ADC System Monitor with Temperature Sensor'."

"The ADC128D818 implements one temperature sensor and seven voltage sensors."

"Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. There is one set of limits. "
"When the HOT Temperature Limit is crossed, this will cause an alarm that "
"will be reasserted until the temperature drops below the HOT Hysteresis. "
"Measurements are guaranteed between -55 and +125 degrees. The temperature "
"measurement has a resolution of 0.5 degrees; the limits have a resolution of "
"1 degree."

"Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in volts. An "
"alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum or "
"maximum limit. Note that minimum in this case always means 'closest to "
"zero'; this is important for negative voltage measurements. All voltage "
"inputs can measure voltages between 0 and 2.55 volts, with a resolution of "
"0.625 mV."

"If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register "
"is read at least once. This means that the cause for the alarm may already "
"have disappeared by the time the alarm is read. The driver caches the alarm "
"status for each sensor until it is at least reported once, to ensure that "
"alarms are reported to user space."

"The ADC128D818 only updates its values approximately once per second; "
"reading it more often will do no harm, but will return 'old' values."

"In addition to the scanned address list, the chip can also be configured for "
"addresses 0x35 to 0x37. Those addresses are not scanned. You have to "
"instantiate the driver explicitly if the chip is configured for any of those "
"addresses in your system."
