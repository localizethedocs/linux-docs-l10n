"LM95233 and LM95234 are 11-bit digital temperature sensors with a 2-wire "
"System Management Bus (SMBus) interface and TrueTherm technology that can "
"very accurately monitor the temperature of two (LM95233) or four (LM95234) "
"remote diodes as well as its own temperature. The remote diodes can be "
"external devices such as microprocessors, graphics processors or diode-"
"connected 2N3904s. The chip's TruTherm beta compensation technology allows "
"sensing of 90 nm or 65 nm process thermal diodes accurately."

"All temperature values are given in millidegrees Celsius. Temperature is "
"provided within a range of -127 to +255 degrees (+127.875 degrees for the "
"internal sensor). Resolution depends on temperature input and range."

"Each sensor has its own maximum limit, but the hysteresis is common to all "
"channels. The hysteresis is configurable with the tem1_max_hyst attribute "
"and affects the hysteresis on all channels. The first two external sensors "
"also have a critical limit."

"The lm95234 driver can change its update interval to a fixed set of values. "
"It will round up to the next selectable interval. See the datasheet for "
"exact values. Reading sensor values more often will do no harm, but will "
"return 'old' values."
