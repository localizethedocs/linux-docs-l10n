"This chip is a bit of a beast.  It has 8 counters for measuring fan speed.  "
"It can also measure 13 voltages or 4 temperatures, or various combinations "
"of the two.  See the chip documentation for more details about the exact set "
"of configurations.  This driver does not allow one to configure the chip; "
"that is left to the system designer."

"A sophisticated control system for the PWM outputs is designed into the "
"ADT7462 that allows fan speed to be adjusted automatically based on any of "
"the three temperature sensors. Each PWM output is individually adjustable "
"and programmable. Once configured, the ADT7462 will adjust the PWM outputs "
"in response to the measured temperatures without further host intervention.  "
"This feature can also be disabled for manual control of the PWM's."

"Each of the measured inputs (voltage, temperature, fan speed) has "

"The ADT7462 samples all inputs continuously. The driver will not read the "
