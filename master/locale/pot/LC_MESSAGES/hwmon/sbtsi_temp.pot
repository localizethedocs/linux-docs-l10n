"The SBI temperature sensor interface (SB-TSI) is an emulation of the "
"software and physical interface of a typical 8-pin remote temperature sensor "
"(RTS) on AMD SoCs. It implements one temperature sensor with readings and "
"limit registers encode the temperature in increments of 0.125 from 0 to "
"255.875. Limits can be set through the writable thresholds, and if reached "
"will trigger corresponding alert signals."
