"\"The EMC6W201 is an environmental monitoring device with automatic fan "
"control capability and enhanced system acoustics for noise suppression. This "
"ACPI compliant device provides hardware monitoring for up to six voltages "
"(including its own VCC) and five external thermal sensors, measures the "
"speed of up to five fans, and controls the speed of multiple DC fans using "
"three Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) outputs. Note that it is possible to "
"control more than three fans by connecting two fans to one PWM output. The "
"EMC6W201 will be available in a 36-pin QFN package.\""

"The driver currently only supports the monitoring of the voltages, "
