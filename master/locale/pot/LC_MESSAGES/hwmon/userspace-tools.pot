"Most mainboards have sensor chips to monitor system health (like "
"temperatures, voltages, fans speed). They are often connected through an I2C "
"bus, but some are also connected directly through the ISA bus."

"The kernel drivers make the data from the sensor chips available in the /sys "
"virtual filesystem. Userspace tools are then used to display the measured "
"values or configure the chips in a more friendly manner."
