"The sa67mcu is a board management controller which also exposes a hardware "
"monitoring controller."

msgid ""
"The controller has two voltage and one temperature sensor. The values are "
"hold in two 8 bit registers to form one 16 bit value. Reading the lower byte "
"will also capture the high byte to make the access atomic. The unit of the "
"volatge sensors are 1mV and the unit of the temperature sensor is 0.1degC."
