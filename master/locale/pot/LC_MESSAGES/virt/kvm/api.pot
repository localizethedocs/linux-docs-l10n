"The kvm API is centered around different kinds of file descriptors and "
"ioctls that can be issued to these file descriptors.  An initial open(\"/dev/"
"kvm\") obtains a handle to the kvm subsystem; this handle can be used to "
"issue system ioctls.  A KVM_CREATE_VM ioctl on this handle will create a VM "
"file descriptor which can be used to issue VM ioctls.  A KVM_CREATE_VCPU or "
"KVM_CREATE_DEVICE ioctl on a VM fd will create a virtual cpu or device and "
"return a file descriptor pointing to the new resource."
