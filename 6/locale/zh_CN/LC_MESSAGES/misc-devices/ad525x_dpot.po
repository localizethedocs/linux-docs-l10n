"The ad525x_dpot driver exports a simple sysfs interface.  This allows you to "
"work with the immediate resistance settings as well as update the saved "
"startup settings.  Access to the factory programmed tolerance is also "
"provided, but interpretation of this settings is required by the end "
"application according to the specific part in use."
