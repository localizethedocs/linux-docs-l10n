"The Coresight dummy trace module is for the specific devices that kernel "
"don't have permission to access or configure, e.g., CoreSight TPDMs on "
"Qualcomm platforms. For these devices, a dummy driver is needed to register "
"them as Coresight devices. The module may also be used to define components "
"that may not have any programming interfaces, so that paths can be created "
"in the driver. It provides Coresight API for operations on dummy devices, "
"such as enabling and disabling them. It also provides the Coresight dummy "
"sink/source paths for debugging."
