"Trace Buffer Extension (TRBE) is a percpu hardware which captures in system "
"memory, CPU traces generated from a corresponding percpu tracing unit. This "
"gets plugged in as a coresight sink device because the corresponding trace "
"generators (ETE), are plugged in as source device."

"The TRBE is not compliant to CoreSight architecture specifications, but is "
"driven via the CoreSight driver framework to support the ETE (which is "
