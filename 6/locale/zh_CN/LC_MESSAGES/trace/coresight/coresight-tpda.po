"TPDA - The trace performance monitoring and diagnostics aggregator or TPDA "
"in short serves as an arbitration and packetization engine for the "
"performance monitoring and diagnostics network specification. The primary "
"use case of the TPDA is to provide packetization, funneling and timestamping "
"of Monitor data."
