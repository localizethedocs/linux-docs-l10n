"HD-audio is the new standard on-board audio component on modern PCs after "
"AC97.  Although Linux has been supporting HD-audio since long time ago, "
"there are often problems with new machines.  A part of the problem is broken "
"BIOS, and the rest is the driver implementation. This document explains the "
"brief trouble-shooting and debugging methods for the HD-audio hardware."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:18
msgid ""
"The HD-audio component consists of two parts: the controller chip and the "
"codec chips on the HD-audio bus.  Linux provides a single driver for all "
"controllers, snd-hda-intel.  Although the driver name contains a word of a "
"well-known hardware vendor, it's not specific to it but for all controller "
"chips by other companies.  Since the HD-audio controllers are supposed to be "
"compatible, the single snd-hda-driver should work in most cases.  But, not "
"surprisingly, there are known bugs and issues specific to each controller "
"type.  The snd-hda-intel driver has a bunch of workarounds for these as "
"described below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:28
msgid ""
"A controller may have multiple codecs.  Usually you have one audio codec and "
"optionally one modem codec.  In theory, there might be multiple audio "
"codecs, e.g. for analog and digital outputs, and the driver might not work "
"properly because of conflict of mixer elements. This should be fixed in "
"future if such hardware really exists."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:34
msgid ""
"The snd-hda-intel driver has several different codec parsers depending on "
"the codec.  It has a generic parser as a fallback, but this functionality is "
"fairly limited until now.  Instead of the generic parser, usually the codec-"
"specific parser (coded in patch_*.c) is used for the codec-specific "
"implementations.  The details about the codec-specific problems are "
"explained in the later sections."

msgid "DMA-Position Problem"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:53
msgid ""
"The most common problem of the controller is the inaccurate DMA pointer "
"reporting.  The DMA pointer for playback and capture can be read in two "
"ways, either via a LPIB register or via a position-buffer map.  As default "
"the driver tries to read from the io-mapped position-buffer, and falls back "
"to LPIB if the position-buffer appears dead.  However, this detection isn't "
"perfect on some devices.  In such a case, you can change the default method "
"via ``position_fix`` option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:61
msgid ""
"``position_fix=1`` means to use LPIB method explicitly. ``position_fix=2`` "
"means to use the position-buffer. ``position_fix=3`` means to use a "
"combination of both methods, needed for some VIA controllers.  The capture "
"stream position is corrected by comparing both LPIB and position-buffer "
"values. ``position_fix=4`` is another combination available for all "
"controllers, and uses LPIB for the playback and the position-buffer for the "
"capture streams. ``position_fix=5`` is specific to Intel platforms, so far, "
"for Skylake and onward.  It applies the delay calculation for the precise "
"position reporting. ``position_fix=6`` is to correct the position with the "
"fixed FIFO size, mainly targeted for the recent AMD controllers. 0 is the "
"default value for all other controllers, the automatic check and fallback to "
"LPIB as described in the above.  If you get a problem of repeated sounds, "
"this option might help."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:79
msgid ""
"In addition to that, every controller is known to be broken regarding the "
"wake-up timing.  It wakes up a few samples before actually processing the "
"data on the buffer.  This caused a lot of problems, for example, with ALSA "
"dmix or JACK.  Since 2.6.27 kernel, the driver puts an artificial delay to "
"the wake up timing.  This delay is controlled via ``bdl_pos_adj`` option."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:86
msgid ""
"When ``bdl_pos_adj`` is a negative value (as default), it's assigned to an "
"appropriate value depending on the controller chip.  For Intel chips, it'd "
"be 1 while it'd be 32 for others.  Usually this works. Only in case it "
"doesn't work and you get warning messages, you should change this parameter "
"to other values."

msgid "Codec-Probing Problem"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:95
msgid ""
"A less often but a more severe problem is the codec probing.  When BIOS "
"reports the available codec slots wrongly, the driver gets confused and "
"tries to access the non-existing codec slot.  This often results in the "
"total screw-up, and destructs the further communication with the codec "
"chips.  The symptom appears usually as error messages like: ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:108
msgid ""
"The first line is a warning, and this is usually relatively harmless. It "
"means that the codec response isn't notified via an IRQ.  The driver uses "
"explicit polling method to read the response.  It gives very slight CPU "
"overhead, but you'd unlikely notice it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:113
msgid ""
"The second line is, however, a fatal error.  If this happens, usually it "
"means that something is really wrong.  Most likely you are accessing a non-"
"existing codec slot."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:117
msgid ""
"Thus, if the second error message appears, try to narrow the probed codec "
"slots via ``probe_mask`` option.  It's a bitmask, and each bit corresponds "
"to the codec slot.  For example, to probe only the first slot, pass "
"``probe_mask=1``.  For the first and the third slots, pass ``probe_mask=5`` "
"(where 5 = 1 | 4), and so on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:123
msgid ""
"Since 2.6.29 kernel, the driver has a more robust probing method, so this "
"error might happen rarely, though."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:126
msgid ""
"On a machine with a broken BIOS, sometimes you need to force the driver to "
"probe the codec slots the hardware doesn't report for use. In such a case, "
"turn the bit 8 (0x100) of ``probe_mask`` option on. Then the rest 8 bits are "
"passed as the codec slots to probe unconditionally.  For example, "
"``probe_mask=0x103`` will force to probe the codec slots 0 and 1 no matter "
"what the hardware reports."

msgid ""
"Even if you see such a message, DON'T PANIC.  Take a deep breath and keep "
"your towel.  First of all, it's an informational message, no warning, no "
"error.  This means that the PCI SSID of your device isn't listed in the "
"known preset model (white-)list.  But, this doesn't mean that the driver is "
"broken.  Many codec-drivers provide the automatic configuration mechanism "
"based on the BIOS setup."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:179
msgid ""
"The HD-audio codec has usually \"pin\" widgets, and BIOS sets the default "
"configuration of each pin, which indicates the location, the connection "
"type, the jack color, etc.  The HD-audio driver can guess the right "
"connection judging from these default configuration values. However -- some "
"codec-support codes, such as patch_analog.c, don't support the automatic "
"probing (yet as of 2.6.28).  And, BIOS is often, yes, pretty often broken.  "
"It sets up wrong values and screws up the driver."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:188
msgid ""
"The preset model (or recently called as \"fix-up\") is provided basically to "
"overcome such a situation.  When the matching preset model is found in the "
"white-list, the driver assumes the static configuration of that preset with "
"the correct pin setup, etc. Thus, if you have a newer machine with a "
"slightly different PCI SSID (or codec SSID) from the existing one, you may "
"have a good chance to re-use the same model.  You can pass the ``model`` "
"option to specify the preset model instead of PCI (and codec-) SSID look-up."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/hd-audio/notes.rst:197
msgid ""
"What ``model`` option values are available depends on the codec chip. Check "
"your codec chip from the codec proc file (see \"Codec Proc-File\" section "
"below).  It will show the vendor/product name of your codec chip.  Then, see "
"Documentation/sound/hd-audio/models.rst file, the section of HD-audio "
"driver.  You can find a list of codecs and ``model`` options belonging to "

"A new style for the model option that was introduced since 5.15 kernel is to "

"YYYY are the sub-vendor and sub-device IDs in hex numbers, respectively.  "
"This is a kind of aliasing to another device; when this form is given, the "
"driver will refer to that SSID as a reference to the quirk table.  It'd be "
"useful especially when the target quirk isn't listed in the model table.  "
"For example, passing model=103c:8862 will apply the quirk for HP ProBook 445 "
