"The ASoC machine (or board) driver is the code that glues together all the "
"component drivers (e.g. codecs, platforms and DAIs). It also describes the "
"relationships between each component which include audio paths, GPIOs, "
"interrupts, clocking, jacks and voltage regulators."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/soc/machine.rst:10
msgid ""
"The machine driver can contain codec and platform specific code. It "
"registers the audio subsystem with the kernel as a platform device and is "
"represented by the following struct:- ::"

"The machine driver has pre and post versions of suspend and resume to take "
"care of any machine audio tasks that have to be done before or after the "
"codec, DAIs and DMA is suspended and resumed. Optional."

msgid "Machine DAI Configuration"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/soc/machine.rst:54
msgid ""
"The machine DAI configuration glues all the codec and CPU DAIs together. It "
"can also be used to set up the DAI system clock and for any machine related "
"DAI initialisation e.g. the machine audio map can be connected to the codec "
"audio map, unconnected codec pins can be set as such."

"In the above struct, daiâ€™s are registered using names but you can pass "
"either dai name or device tree node but not both. Also, names used here for "
"cpu/codec/platform dais should be globally unique."

"Following this, ``devm_snd_soc_register_card`` can be used to register the "
"sound card. During the registration, the individual components such as the "
"codec, CPU, and platform are probed. If all these components are "
"successfully probed, the sound card gets registered."

msgid "Machine Power Map"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../sound/soc/machine.rst:104
msgid ""
"The machine driver can optionally extend the codec power map and to become "
"an audio power map of the audio subsystem. This allows for automatic power "
"up/down of speaker/HP amplifiers, etc. Codec pins can be connected to the "
"machines jack sockets in the machine init function."

"As previously noted, clock configuration is handled within the machine "
"driver. For details on the clock APIs that the machine driver can utilize "
"for setup, please refer to Documentation/sound/soc/clocking.rst. However, "
"the callback needs to be registered by the CPU/Codec/Platform drivers to "
"configure the clocks that is needed for the corresponding device operation."
