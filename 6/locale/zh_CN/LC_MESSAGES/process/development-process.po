"The purpose of this document is to help developers (and their managers) work "
"with the development community with a minimum of frustration.  It is an "
"attempt to document how this community works in a way which is accessible to "
"those who are not intimately familiar with Linux kernel development (or, "
"indeed, free software development in general).  While there is some "
"technical material here, this is very much a process-oriented discussion "
"which does not require a deep knowledge of kernel programming to understand."
