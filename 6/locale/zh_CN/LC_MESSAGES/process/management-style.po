"This is a short document describing the preferred (or made up, depending on "
"who you ask) management style for the linux kernel.  It's meant to mirror "
"the :ref:`process/coding-style.rst <codingstyle>` document to some degree, "
"and mainly written to avoid answering [#f1]_  the same (or similar) "
"questions over and over again."

"Management style is very personal and much harder to quantify than simple "
"coding style rules, so this document may or may not have anything to do with "
"reality.  It started as a lark, but that doesn't mean that it might not "
"actually be true. You'll have to decide for yourself."

"Btw, when talking about \"kernel manager\", it's all about the technical "
"lead persons, not the people who do traditional management inside "
"companies.  If you sign purchase orders or you have any clue about the "
"budget of your group, you're almost certainly not a kernel manager. These "
"suggestions may or may not apply to you."

msgid "1) Decisions"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:37
msgid ""
"Everybody thinks managers make decisions, and that decision-making is "
"important.  The bigger and more painful the decision, the bigger the manager "
"must be to make it.  That's very deep and obvious, but it's not actually "
"true."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:42
msgid ""
"The name of the game is to **avoid** having to make a decision.  In "
"particular, if somebody tells you \"choose (a) or (b), we really need you to "
"decide on this\", you're in trouble as a manager.  The people you manage had "
"better know the details better than you, so if they come to you for a "
"technical decision, you're screwed.  You're clearly not competent to make "
"that decision for them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:49
msgid ""
"(Corollary:if the people you manage don't know the details better than you, "
"you're also screwed, although for a totally different reason. Namely that "
"you are in the wrong job, and that **they** should be managing your "
"brilliance instead)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:54
msgid ""
"So the name of the game is to **avoid** decisions, at least the big and "
"painful ones.  Making small and non-consequential decisions is fine, and "
"makes you look like you know what you're doing, so what a kernel manager "
"needs to do is to turn the big and painful ones into small things where "
"nobody really cares."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:60
msgid ""
"It helps to realize that the key difference between a big decision and a "
"small one is whether you can fix your decision afterwards.  Any decision can "
"be made small by just always making sure that if you were wrong (and you "
"**will** be wrong), you can always undo the damage later by backtracking.  "
"Suddenly, you get to be doubly managerial for making **two** inconsequential "
"decisions - the wrong one **and** the right one."

msgid ""
"And people will even see that as true leadership (*cough* bullshit *cough*)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:70
msgid ""
"Thus the key to avoiding big decisions becomes to just avoiding to do things "
"that can't be undone.  Don't get ushered into a corner from which you cannot "
"escape.  A cornered rat may be dangerous - a cornered manager is just "
"pitiful."

"It turns out that since nobody would be stupid enough to ever really let a "
"kernel manager have huge fiscal responsibility **anyway**, it's usually "
"fairly easy to backtrack.  Since you're not going to be able to waste huge "
"amounts of money that you might not be able to repay, the only thing you can "
"backtrack on is a technical decision, and there back-tracking is very easy: "
"just tell everybody that you were an incompetent nincompoop, say you're "
"sorry, and undo all the worthless work you had people work on for the last "
"year.  Suddenly the decision you made a year ago wasn't a big decision after "
"all, since it could be easily undone."

"It turns out that some people have trouble with this approach, for two "
"reasons:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:89
msgid ""
"admitting you were an idiot is harder than it looks.  We all like to "
"maintain appearances, and coming out in public to say that you were wrong is "
"sometimes very hard indeed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:92
msgid ""
"having somebody tell you that what you worked on for the last year wasn't "
"worthwhile after all can be hard on the poor lowly engineers too, and while "
"the actual **work** was easy enough to undo by just deleting it, you may "
"have irrevocably lost the trust of that engineer.  And remember: "
"\"irrevocable\" was what we tried to avoid in the first place, and your "
"decision ended up being a big one after all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:100
msgid ""
"Happily, both of these reasons can be mitigated effectively by just "
"admitting up-front that you don't have a friggin' clue, and telling people "
"ahead of the fact that your decision is purely preliminary, and might be the "
"wrong thing.  You should always reserve the right to change your mind, and "
"make people very **aware** of that.  And it's much easier to admit that you "
"are stupid when you haven't **yet** done the really stupid thing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:108
msgid ""
"Then, when it really does turn out to be stupid, people just roll their eyes "
"and say \"Oops, not again\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:111
msgid ""
"This preemptive admission of incompetence might also make the people who "
"actually do the work also think twice about whether it's worth doing or "
"not.  After all, if **they** aren't certain whether it's a good idea, you "
"sure as hell shouldn't encourage them by promising them that what they work "
"on will be included.  Make them at least think twice before they embark on a "
"big endeavor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Remember: they'd better know more about the details than you do, and they "
"usually already think they have the answer to everything.  The best thing "
"you can do as a manager is not to instill confidence, but rather a healthy "
"dose of critical thinking on what they do."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/management-style.rst:123
msgid ""
"Btw, another way to avoid a decision is to plaintively just whine \"can't we "
"just do both?\" and look pitiful.  Trust me, it works.  If it's not clear "
"which approach is better, they'll eventually figure it out.  The answer may "
"end up being that both teams get so frustrated by the situation that they "
"just give up."

msgid ""
"That may sound like a failure, but it's usually a sign that there was "
"something wrong with both projects, and the reason the people involved "
"couldn't decide was that they were both wrong.  You end up coming up "

"However, in order to prepare yourself as a kernel manager, it's best to "
