"Watchdog functionality is enabled like any other common watchdog driver. "
"That is, an application needs to be started that kicks off the watchdog "
"timer. A basic application exists in tools/testing/selftests/watchdog/ named "
"watchdog-test.c. Simply compile the C file and kick it off. If the system "
"gets into a bad state and hangs, the HPE ProLiant iLO timer register will "
"not be updated in a timely fashion and a hardware system reset (also known "
"as an Automatic Server Recovery (ASR)) event will occur."
