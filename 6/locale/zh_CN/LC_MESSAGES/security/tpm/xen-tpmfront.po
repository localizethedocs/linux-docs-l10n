"The goal of this work is to provide a TPM functionality to a virtual guest "
"operating system (in Xen terms, a DomU).  This allows programs to interact "
"with a TPM in a virtual system the same way they interact with a TPM on the "
"physical system.  Each guest gets its own unique, emulated, software TPM.  "
"However, each of the vTPM's secrets (Keys, NVRAM, etc) are managed by a vTPM "
"Manager domain, which seals the secrets to the Physical TPM.  If the process "
"of creating each of these domains (manager, vTPM, and guest) is trusted, the "
"vTPM subsystem extends the chain of trust rooted in the hardware TPM to "
"virtual machines in Xen. Each major component of vTPM is implemented as a "
"separate domain, providing secure separation guaranteed by the hypervisor. "
"The vTPM domains are implemented in mini-os to reduce memory and processor "
"overhead."
