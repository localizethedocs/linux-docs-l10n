"The Linux NFS server now supports the pNFS block layout extension.  In this "
"case the NFS server acts as Metadata Server (MDS) for pNFS, which in "
"addition to handling all the metadata access to the NFS export also hands "
"out layouts to the clients to directly access the underlying block devices "
"that are shared with the client."

"To use pNFS block layouts with the Linux NFS server the exported file system "
"needs to support the pNFS block layouts (currently just XFS), and the file "
"system must sit on shared storage (typically iSCSI) that is accessible to "
"the clients in addition to the MDS.  As of now the file system needs to sit "
"directly on the exported volume, striping or concatenation of volumes on the "
"MDS and clients is not supported yet."

"On the server, pNFS block volume support is automatically if the file system "
"support it.  On the client make sure the kernel has the CONFIG_PNFS_BLOCK "
"option enabled, the blkmapd daemon from nfs-utils is running, and the file "
"system is mounted using the NFSv4.1 protocol version (mount -o vers=4.1)."
