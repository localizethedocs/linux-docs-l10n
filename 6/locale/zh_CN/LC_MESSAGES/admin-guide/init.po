"This document provides some high-level reasons for failure (listed roughly "
"in order of execution) to load the init binary."

"**Unable to mount root FS**: Set \"debug\" kernel parameter (in bootloader "
"config file or CONFIG_CMDLINE) to get more detailed kernel messages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**init binary doesn't exist on rootfs**: Make sure you have the correct root "
"FS type (and ``root=`` kernel parameter points to the correct partition), "
"required drivers such as storage hardware (such as SCSI or USB!) and "
"filesystem (ext3, jffs2, etc.) are builtin (alternatively as modules, to be "
"pre-loaded by an initrd)."

#: ../../../admin-guide/init.rst:18
msgid ""
"**Broken console device**: Possibly a conflict in ``console= setup`` --> "
"initial console unavailable. E.g. some serial consoles are unreliable due to "
"serial IRQ issues (e.g. missing interrupt-based configuration). Try using a "
"different ``console= device`` or e.g. ``netconsole=``."

"**Binary exists but dependencies not available**: E.g. required library "
"dependencies of the init binary such as ``/lib/ld-linux.so.2`` missing or "
"broken. Use ``readelf -d <INIT>|grep NEEDED`` to find out which libraries "
"are required."

msgid ""
"**Binary cannot be loaded**: Make sure the binary's architecture matches "
"your hardware. E.g. i386 vs. x86_64 mismatch, or trying to load x86 on ARM "
"hardware. In case you tried loading a non-binary file here (shell script?), "
"you should make sure that the script specifies an interpreter in its shebang "
"header line (``#!/...``) that is fully working (including its library "
"dependencies). And before tackling scripts, better first test a simple non-"
"script binary such as ``/bin/sh`` and confirm its successful execution. To "
"find out more, add code ``to init/main.c`` to display kernel_execve()s "
"return values."

"Please extend this explanation whenever you find new failure causes (after "
"all loading the init binary is a CRITICAL and hard transition step which "
"needs to be made as painless as possible), then submit a patch to LKML. "

"Implement the various ``run_init_process()`` invocations via a struct array "
"which can then store the ``kernel_execve()`` result value and on failure log "
"it all by iterating over **all** results (very important usability fix)."
