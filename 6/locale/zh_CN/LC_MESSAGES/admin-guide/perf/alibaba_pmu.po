"The DDR Controller (DDRCTL) and DDR PHY combine to create a complete "

"DDRCTL receives transactions Host Interface (HIF) which is custom-defined by "
"Synopsys. These transactions are queued internally and scheduled for access "
"while satisfying the SDRAM protocol timing requirements, transaction "
"priorities, and dependencies between the transactions. The DDRCTL in turn "
"issues commands on the DDR PHY Interface (DFI) to the PHY module, which "
"launches and captures data to and from the SDRAM. The driveway PMUs have "
