"CCN-504 is a ring-bus interconnect consisting of 11 crosspoints (XPs), with "
"each crosspoint supporting up to two device ports, so nodes (devices) 0 and "
"1 are connected to crosspoint 0, nodes 2 and 3 to crosspoint 1 etc."

"this processor (if not, the perf_event->cpu value will be overwritten "
"anyway). In case of this processor being offlined, the events are migrated "
"to another one and the attribute is updated."
