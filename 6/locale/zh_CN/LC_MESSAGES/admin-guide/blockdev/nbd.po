"What is it: With this compiled in the kernel (or as a module), Linux can use "
"a remote server as one of its block devices. So every time the client "
"computer wants to read, e.g., /dev/nb0, it sends a request over TCP to the "
"server, which will reply with the data read. This can be used for stations "
"with low disk space (or even diskless) to borrow disk space from another "
"computer. Unlike NFS, it is possible to put any filesystem on it, etc."

"The nbd kernel module need only be installed on the client system, as the "
"nbd-server is completely in userspace. In fact, the nbd-server has been "
"successfully ported to other operating systems, including Windows."
