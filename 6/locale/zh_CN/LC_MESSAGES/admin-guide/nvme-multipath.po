"The NVMe multipath feature in Linux integrates namespaces with the same "
"identifier into a single block device. Using multipath enhances the "
"reliability and stability of I/O access while improving bandwidth "
"performance. When a user sends I/O to this merged block device, the "
"multipath mechanism selects one of the underlying block devices (paths) "
"according to the configured policy. Different policies result in different "
"path selections."

"All policies follow the ANA (Asymmetric Namespace Access) mechanism, meaning "
"that when an optimized path is available, it will be chosen over a non-"
"optimized one. Current the NVMe multipath policies include numa(default), "
"round-robin and queue-depth."

"To set the desired policy (e.g., round-robin), use one of the following "
