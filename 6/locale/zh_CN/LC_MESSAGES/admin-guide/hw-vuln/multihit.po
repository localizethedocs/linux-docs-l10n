msgid ""
"iTLB multihit is an erratum where some processors may incur a machine check "
"error, possibly resulting in an unrecoverable CPU lockup, when an "
"instruction fetch hits multiple entries in the instruction TLB. This can "
"occur when the page size is changed along with either the physical address "
"or cache type. A malicious guest running on a virtualized system can exploit "
"this erratum to perform a denial of service attack."

"Privileged software, including OS and virtual machine managers (VMM), are in "
"charge of memory management. A key component in memory management is the "
"control of the page tables. Modern processors use virtual memory, a "
"technique that creates the illusion of a very large memory for processors. "
"This virtual space is split into pages of a given size. Page tables "
"translate virtual addresses to physical addresses."

"To reduce latency when performing a virtual to physical address translation, "

"the page structure modification but before the software invalidates any iTLB "
"entries for the linear address, a code fetch that happens on the same linear "
