"The kernel will mark itself as 'tainted' when something occurs that might be "
"relevant later when investigating problems. Don't worry too much about this, "
"most of the time it's not a problem to run a tainted kernel; the information "
"is mainly of interest once someone wants to investigate some problem, as its "
"real cause might be the event that got the kernel tainted. That's why bug "
"reports from tainted kernels will often be ignored by developers, hence try "
"to reproduce problems with an untainted kernel."

"Note the kernel will remain tainted even after you undo what caused the "
"taint (i.e. unload a proprietary kernel module), to indicate the kernel "
"remains not trustworthy. That's also why the kernel will print the tainted "
"state when it notices an internal problem (a 'kernel bug'), a recoverable "
"error ('kernel oops') or a non-recoverable error ('kernel panic') and writes "
"debug information about this to the logs ``dmesg`` outputs. It's also "
"possible to check the tainted state at runtime through a file in ``/proc/``."

"At runtime, you can query the tainted state by reading ``cat /proc/sys/"

"You can try to decode the number yourself. That's easy if there was only one "

"number, as it is a bitfield, where each bit indicates the absence or "
"presence of a particular type of taint. It's best to leave that to the "
"aforementioned script, but if you need something quick you can use this "
