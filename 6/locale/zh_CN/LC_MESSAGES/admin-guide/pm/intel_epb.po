"The Performance and Energy Bias Hint (EPB) allows software to specify its "
"preference with respect to the power-performance tradeoffs present in the "
"processor.  Generally, the EPB is expected to be set by user space (directly "
"via sysfs or with the help of the x86_energy_perf_policy tool), but there "
"are two reasons for the kernel to update it."

"First, there are systems where the platform firmware resets the EPB during "
"system-wide transitions from sleep states back into the working state "
"effectively causing the previous EPB updates by user space to be lost. Thus "
"the kernel needs to save the current EPB values for all CPUs during system-"
"wide transitions to sleep states and restore them on the way back to the "
"working state.  That can be achieved by saving EPB for secondary CPUs when "
"they are taken offline during transitions into system sleep states and for "
"the boot CPU in a syscore suspend operation, so that it can be restored for "
"the boot CPU in a syscore resume operation and for the other CPUs when they "
"are brought back online.  However, CPUs that are already offline when a "
"system-wide PM transition is started are not taken offline again, but their "
"EPB values may still be reset by the platform firmware during the "
"transition, so in fact it is necessary to save the EPB of any CPU taken "
"offline and to restore it when the given CPU goes back online at all times."

"Second, on many systems the initial EPB value coming from the platform "
"firmware is 0 ('performance') and at least on some of them that is because "
"the platform firmware does not initialize EPB at all with the assumption "
"that the OS will do that anyway.  That sometimes is problematic, as it may "
"cause the system battery to drain too fast, for example, so it is better to "
"adjust it on CPU bring-up and if the initial EPB value for a given CPU is 0, "
"the kernel changes it to 6 ('normal')."
