"The kernel contains many kinds of objects that either don't have individual "
"limits or that have limits which are ineffective when a set of processes is "
"allowed to switch their UID. On a system where the admins don't trust their "
"users or their users' programs, user namespaces expose the system to "
"potential misuse of resources."

"In order to mitigate this, we recommend that admins enable memory control "
"groups on any system that enables user namespaces. Furthermore, we recommend "
"that admins configure the memory control groups to limit the maximum memory "
"usable by any untrusted user."

"Memory control groups can be configured by installing the libcgroup package "
"present on most distros editing /etc/cgrules.conf, /etc/cgconfig.conf and "
"setting up libpam-cgroup."
