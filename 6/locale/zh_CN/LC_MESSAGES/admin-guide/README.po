"Linux is easily portable to most general-purpose 32- or 64-bit architectures "
"as long as they have a paged memory management unit (PMMU) and a port of the "
"GNU C compiler (gcc) (part of The GNU Compiler Collection, GCC). Linux has "
"also been ported to a number of architectures without a PMMU, although "
"functionality is then obviously somewhat limited. Linux has also been ported "
"to itself. You can now run the kernel as a userspace application - this is "
"called UserMode Linux (UML)."
