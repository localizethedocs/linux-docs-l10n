"The i.MX7 contrary to the i.MX5/6 family does not contain an Image "
"Processing Unit (IPU); because of that the capabilities to perform "
"operations or manipulation of the capture frames are less feature rich."

"This is the MIPI CSI-2 receiver entity. It has one sink pad to receive the "

msgid ""
"To aid in configuration and for backward compatibility with V4L2 "
"applications that access controls only from video device nodes, the capture "
"device interfaces inherit controls from the active entities in the current "
"pipeline, so controls can be accessed either directly from the subdev or "
"from the active capture device interface. For example, the sensor controls "
"are available either from the sensor subdevs or from the active capture "
"device."
