"Most analog and digital TV boards support remote controllers. Several of "
"them have a microprocessor that receives the IR carriers, convert into pulse/"
"space sequences and then to scan codes, returning such codes to userspace "
"(\"scancode mode\"). Other boards return just the pulse/space sequences "
"(\"raw mode\")."
