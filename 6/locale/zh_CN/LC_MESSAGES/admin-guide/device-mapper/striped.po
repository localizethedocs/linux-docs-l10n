"Device-Mapper's \"striped\" target is used to create a striped (i.e. RAID-0) "
"device across one or more underlying devices. Data is written in \"chunks\", "
"with consecutive chunks rotating among the underlying devices. This can "
"potentially provide improved I/O throughput by utilizing several physical "
"devices in parallel."
