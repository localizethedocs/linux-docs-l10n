"For Rx the two submission rings are used to pass empty pages to the NIC. "

"headers (or full frames if frame is not header-data split). Ring 1 is the "
"Payload Page Queue (PPQ) and used for packet payloads. The completion ring "
"is used to receive packet notifications / metadata. ethtool ``rx`` ringparam "

"jumbo`` to the PPQ."
