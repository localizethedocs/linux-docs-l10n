"The eTSEC controller (first included in parts from late 2005 like the 8548) "
"has the ability to perform TCP, UDP, and IP checksums in hardware.  The "
"Linux kernel only offloads the TCP and UDP checksums (and always performs "
"the pseudo header checksums), so the driver only supports checksumming for "
"TCP/IP and UDP/IP packets.  Use ethtool to enable or disable this feature "
"for RX and TX."

"In order to use VLAN, please consult Linux documentation on configuring "
"VLANs.  The gianfar driver supports hardware insertion and extraction of "
"VLAN headers, but not filtering.  Filtering will be done by the kernel."

"The gianfar driver supports using the group hash table on the TSEC (and the "
"extended hash table on the eTSEC) for multicast filtering.  On the eTSEC, "
"the exact-match MAC registers are used before the hash tables.  See Linux "
"documentation on how to join multicast groups."
