"As my third year dissertation at University I have taken it upon myself to "
"write an X.25 implementation for Linux. My aim is to provide a complete X.25 "
"Packet Layer and a LAPB module to allow for \"normal\" X.25 to be run using "
"Linux. There are two sorts of X.25 cards available, intelligent ones that "
"implement LAPB on the card itself, and unintelligent ones that simply do "
"framing, bit-stuffing and checksumming. These both need to be handled by the "
"system."

"I therefore decided to write the implementation such that as far as the "
"Packet Layer is concerned, the link layer was being performed by a lower "
"layer of the Linux kernel and therefore it did not concern itself with "
"implementation of LAPB. Therefore the LAPB modules would be called by "
"unintelligent X.25 card drivers and not by intelligent ones, this would "
"provide a uniform device driver interface, and simplify configuration."

"To confuse matters a little, an 802.2 LLC implementation is also possible "
"which could allow X.25 to be run over an Ethernet (or Token Ring) and "
"conform with the JNT \"Pink Book\", this would have a different interface to "
"the Packet Layer but there would be no confusion since the class of device "
"being served by the LLC would be completely separate from LAPB."

"Just when you thought that it could not become more confusing, another "
"option appeared, XOT. This allows X.25 Packet Layer frames to operate over "
"the Internet using TCP/IP as a reliable link layer. RFC1613 specifies the "
"format and behaviour of the protocol. If time permits this option will also "
"be actively considered."
