"This is conceptually very similar to the macvlan driver with one major "
"exception of using L3 for mux-ing /demux-ing among slaves. This property "
"makes the master device share the L2 with its slave devices. I have "
"developed this driver in conjunction with network namespaces and not sure if "
"there is use case outside of it."

"In order to build the driver, please select the config item CONFIG_IPVLAN. "
"The driver can be built into the kernel (CONFIG_IPVLAN=y) or as a module "
"(CONFIG_IPVLAN=m)."

msgid ""
"IPvlan has two modes of operation - L2 and L3. For a given master device, "
"you can select one of these two modes and all slaves on that master will "
"operate in the same (selected) mode. The RX mode is almost identical except "
"that in L3 mode the slaves won't receive any multicast / broadcast traffic. "
"L3 mode is more restrictive since routing is controlled from the other "
"(mostly) default namespace."

msgid "4.1 L2 mode:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/ipvlan.rst:71
msgid ""
"In this mode TX processing happens on the stack instance attached to the "
"slave device and packets are switched and queued to the master device to "
"send out. In this mode the slaves will RX/TX multicast and broadcast (if "
"applicable) as well."

msgid "4.2 L3 mode:"

#: ../../../networking/ipvlan.rst:79
msgid ""
"In this mode TX processing up to L3 happens on the stack instance attached "
"to the slave device and packets are switched to the stack instance of the "
"master device for the L2 processing and routing from that instance will be "
"used before packets are queued on the outbound device. In this mode the "
"slaves will not receive nor can send multicast / broadcast traffic."

msgid "4.3 L3S mode:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/ipvlan.rst:88
msgid ""
"This is very similar to the L3 mode except that iptables (conn-tracking) "
"works in this mode and hence it is L3-symmetric (L3s). This will have "
"slightly less performance but that shouldn't matter since you are choosing "
"this mode over plain-L3 mode to make conn-tracking work."

"This is the default option. To configure the IPvlan port in this mode, user "

"If this is added to the command-line, the port is set in VEPA mode. i.e. "
"port will offload switching functionality to the external entity as "
"described in 802.1Qbg Note: VEPA mode in IPvlan has limitations. IPvlan uses "
"the mac-address of the master-device, so the packets which are emitted in "
"this mode for the adjacent neighbor will have source and destination mac "
"same. This will make the switch / router send the redirect message."
