"SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) is a IP based, message oriented, "
"reliable transport protocol, with congestion control, support for "
"transparent multi-homing, and multiple ordered streams of messages. RFC2960 "
"defines the core protocol.  The IETF SIGTRAN working group originally "
"developed the SCTP protocol and later handed the protocol over to the "
"Transport Area (TSVWG) working group for the continued evolvement of SCTP as "
"a general purpose transport."

"The initial project goal is to create an Linux kernel reference "
"implementation of SCTP that is RFC 2960 compliant and provides an "
"programming interface referred to as the  UDP-style API of the Sockets "
"Extensions for SCTP, as proposed in IETF Internet-Drafts."
