msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/gtp.rst:17
msgid ""
"GTP is the Generic Tunnel Protocol, which is a 3GPP protocol used for "
"tunneling User-IP payload between a mobile station (phone, modem) and the "
"interconnection between an external packet data network (such as the "
"internet)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/gtp.rst:22
msgid ""
"So when you start a 'data connection' from your mobile phone, the phone will "
"use the control plane to signal for the establishment of such a tunnel "
"between that external data network and the phone.  The tunnel endpoints thus "
"reside on the phone and in the gateway.  All intermediate nodes just "
"transport the encapsulated packet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/gtp.rst:28
msgid ""
"The phone itself does not implement GTP but uses some other technology-"
"dependent protocol stack for transmitting the user IP payload, such as LLC/"
"SNDCP/RLC/MAC."

msgid ""
"At some network element inside the cellular operator infrastructure (SGSN in "
"case of GPRS/EGPRS or classic UMTS, hNodeB in case of a 3G femtocell, eNodeB "
"in case of 4G/LTE), the cellular protocol stacking is translated into GTP "
"*without breaking the end-to-end tunnel*.  So intermediate nodes just "
"perform some specific relay function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/gtp.rst:38
msgid ""
"At some point the GTP packet ends up on the so-called GGSN (GSM/UMTS) or P-"
"GW (LTE), which terminates the tunnel, decapsulates the packet and forwards "
"it onto an external packet data network.  This can be public internet, but "
"can also be any private IP network (or even theoretically some non-IP "
"network like X.25)."

"C)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/gtp.rst:63
msgid ""
"So in order to have a working GGSN/P-GW setup, you will need a userspace "

"module."

"This split architecture follows the tunneling modules of other protocols, e."
