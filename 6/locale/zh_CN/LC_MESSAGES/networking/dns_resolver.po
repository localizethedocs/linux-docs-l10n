"The DNS resolver module provides a way for kernel services to make DNS "
"queries by way of requesting a key of key type dns_resolver.  These queries "
"are upcalled to userspace through /sbin/request-key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:24
msgid ""
"These routines must be supported by userspace tools dns.upcall, cifs.upcall "
"and request-key.  It is under development and does not yet provide the full "
"feature set.  The features it does support include:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:48
msgid ""
"To set up this facility, the /etc/request-key.conf file must be altered so "
"that /sbin/request-key can appropriately direct the upcalls.  For example, "
"to handle basic dname to IPv4/IPv6 address resolution, the following line "
"should be added::"

"To direct a query for query type 'foo', a line of the following should be "
"added before the more general line given above as the first match is the one "
"taken::"

"The kernel maintains an internal keyring in which it caches looked up keys. "

"Keys of dns_resolver type can be read from userspace using keyctl_read() or "

msgid "Mechanism"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:121
msgid ""
"The dns_resolver module registers a key type called \"dns_resolver\".  Keys "
"of this type are used to transport and cache DNS lookup results from "
"userspace."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:124
msgid ""
"When dns_query() is invoked, it calls request_key() to search the local "
"keyrings for a cached DNS result.  If that fails to find one, it upcalls to "
"userspace to get a new result."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:128
msgid ""
"Upcalls to userspace are made through the request_key() upcall vector, and "
"are directed by means of configuration lines in /etc/request-key.conf that "
"tell /sbin/request-key what program to run to instantiate the key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:132
msgid ""
"The upcall handler program is responsible for querying the DNS, processing "
"the result into a form suitable for passing to the keyctl_instantiate_key() "
"routine.  This then passes the data to dns_resolver_instantiate() which "
"strips off and processes any options included in the data, and then attaches "
"the remainder of the string to the key as its payload."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:138
msgid ""
"The upcall handler program should set the expiry time on the key to that of "
"the lowest TTL of all the records it has extracted a result from.  This "
"means that the key will be discarded and recreated when the data it holds "
"has expired."

"dns_query() returns a copy of the value attached to the key, or an error if "
