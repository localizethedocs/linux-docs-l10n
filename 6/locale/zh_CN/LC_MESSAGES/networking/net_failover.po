"The net_failover driver provides an automated failover mechanism via APIs to "
"create and destroy a failover master netdev and manages a primary and "
"standby slave netdevs that get registered via the generic failover "
"infrastructure."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/net_failover.rst:15
msgid ""
"The failover netdev acts a master device and controls 2 slave devices. The "
"original paravirtual interface is registered as 'standby' slave netdev and a "
"passthru/vf device with the same MAC gets registered as 'primary' slave "
"netdev. Both 'standby' and 'failover' netdevs are associated with the same "
"'pci' device. The user accesses the network interface via 'failover' netdev. "
"The 'failover' netdev chooses 'primary' netdev as default for transmits when "
"it is available with link up and running."

"This can be used by paravirtual drivers to enable an alternate low latency "
"datapath. It also enables hypervisor controlled live migration of a VM with "
"direct attached VF by failing over to the paravirtual datapath when the VF "
"is unplugged."

"net_failover enables hypervisor controlled accelerated datapath to virtio-"
"net enabled VMs in a transparent manner with no/minimal guest userspace "

#: ../../../networking/net_failover.rst:34
msgid ""
"To support this, the hypervisor needs to enable VIRTIO_NET_F_STANDBY feature "
"on the virtio-net interface and assign the same MAC address to both virtio-"
"net and VF interfaces."

"Here is an example libvirt XML snippet that shows such configuration: ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/net_failover.rst:59
msgid ""
"In this configuration, the first device definition is for the virtio-net "
"interface and this acts as the 'persistent' device indicating that this "
"interface will always be plugged in. This is specified by the 'teaming' tag "
"with required attribute type having value 'persistent'. The link state for "
"the virtio-net device is set to 'down' to ensure that the 'failover' netdev "
"prefers the VF passthrough device for normal communication. The virtio-net "
"device will be brought UP during live migration to allow uninterrupted "
"communication."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/net_failover.rst:67
msgid ""
"The second device definition is for the VF passthrough interface. Here the "
"'teaming' tag is provided with type 'transient' indicating that this device "
"may periodically be unplugged. A second attribute - 'persistent' is provided "
"and points to the alias name declared for the virtio-net device."

"Booting a VM with the above configuration will result in the following 3 "
"interfaces created in the VM: ::"

#: ../../../networking/net_failover.rst:87
msgid ""
"Here, ens10 is the 'failover' master interface, ens10nsby is the slave "
"'standby' virtio-net interface, and ens11 is the slave 'primary' VF "
"passthrough interface."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/net_failover.rst:90
msgid ""
"One point to note here is that some user space network configuration daemons "
"like systemd-networkd, ifupdown, etc, do not understand the 'net_failover' "
"device; and on the first boot, the VM might end up with both 'failover' "
"device and VF acquiring IP addresses (either same or different) from the "
"DHCP server. This will result in lack of connectivity to the VM. So some "
"tweaks might be needed to these network configuration daemons to make sure "
"that an IP is received only on the 'failover' device."

"Here is a sample script that shows the steps to initiate live migration from "
"the source hypervisor. Note: It is assumed that the VM is connected to a "
