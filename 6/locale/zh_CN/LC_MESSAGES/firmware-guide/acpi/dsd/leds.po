"Individual LEDs are described by hierarchical data extension [5] nodes under "
"the device node, the LED driver chip. The \"reg\" property in the LED "
"specific nodes tells the numerical ID of each individual LED output to which "
"the LEDs are connected. [leds] The hierarchical data nodes are named "
"\"led@X\", where X is the number of the LED output."

"ACPI allows (as does DT) using integer arguments after the reference. A "
"combination of the LED driver device reference and an integer argument, "
"referring to the \"reg\" property of the relevant LED, is used to identify "
"individual LEDs. The value of the \"reg\" property is a contract between the "
"firmware and software, it uniquely identifies the LED driver outputs."

"Under the LED driver device, The first hierarchical data extension package "

"LED, followed by the referred object name. That object shall be named "
