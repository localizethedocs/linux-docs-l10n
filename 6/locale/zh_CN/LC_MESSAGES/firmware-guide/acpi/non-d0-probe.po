"The _DSC (Device State for Configuration) object that evaluates to an "
"integer may be used to tell Linux the highest allowed D state for a device "
"during probe. The support for _DSC requires support from the kernel bus type "
"if the bus driver normally sets the device in D0 state for probe."

#: ../../../firmware-guide/acpi/non-d0-probe.rst:22
msgid ""
"The downside of using _DSC is that as the device is not powered on, even if "
"there's a problem with the device, the driver likely probes just fine but "
"the first user will find out the device doesn't work, instead of a failure "
"at probe time. This feature should thus be used sparingly."

"_DSC object evaluates to integer higher than the D state of the device, the "
