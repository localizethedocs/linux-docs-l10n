"A device driver that registers with the firmware loader will expose "
"persistent sysfs nodes to enable users to initiate firmware updates for that "
"device.  It is the responsibility of the device driver and/or the device "
"itself to perform any validation on the data received. Firmware upload uses "
"the same *loading* and *data* sysfs files described in the documentation for "
"firmware fallback. It also adds additional sysfs files to provide status on "
"the transfer of the firmware image to the device."

"A device driver registers for firmware upload by calling "
"firmware_upload_register(). Among the parameter list is a name to identify "
"the device under /sys/class/firmware. A user may initiate a firmware upload "
"by echoing a 1 to the *loading* sysfs file for the target device. Next, the "
"user writes the firmware image to the *data* sysfs file. After writing the "
"firmware data, the user echos 0 to the *loading* sysfs file to signal "
"completion. Echoing 0 to *loading* also triggers the transfer of the "
"firmware to the lower-lever device driver in the context of a kernel worker "
"thread."
