"The main purpose of the Industrial I/O subsystem (IIO) is to provide support "
"for devices that in some sense perform either analog-to-digital conversion "
"(ADC) or digital-to-analog conversion (DAC) or both. The aim is to fill the "
"gap between the somewhat similar hwmon and :doc:`input <../input>` "
"subsystems. Hwmon is directed at low sample rate sensors used to monitor and "
"control the system itself, like fan speed control or temperature "
"measurement. :doc:`Input <../input>` is, as its name suggests, focused on "
"human interaction input devices (keyboard, mouse, touchscreen). In some "
"cases there is considerable overlap between these and IIO."

"Usually these sensors are connected via :doc:`SPI <../spi>` or :doc:`I2C <../"
"i2c>`. A common use case of the sensors devices is to have combined "
"functionality (e.g. light plus proximity sensor)."
