"This document was made based on 'C' code for Linux from Gideon le Grange "
"(legrang@active.co.za or legrang@cs.sun.ac.za) in 1994, and elaborations "
"from Frans Brinkman (brinkman@esd.nl) in 1996.  The results reported here "

"mileage may vary... I make no guarantees, claims or warranties to the "
"suitability or validity of this information.  No other documentation on the "
"AIMS Lab (http://www.aimslab.com/) RadioTrack card was made available to the "

"want to use the RadioTrack card in an environment other than MS Windows."

"I have a RadioTrack card from back when I ran an MS-Windows platform.  After "
"converting to Linux, I found Gideon le Grange's command-line software for "
"running the card, and found that it was good!  Frans Brinkman made a "
"comfortable X-windows interface, and added a scanning feature.  For hack "
"value, I wanted to see if the tuner could be tuned beyond the usual FM radio "
"broadcast band, so I could pick up the audio carriers from North American "
"broadcast TV channels, situated just below and above the 87.0-109.0 MHz "
"range. I did not get much success, but I learned about programming ioports "
"under Linux and gained some insights about the hardware design used for the "
"card."

#: ../../../driver-api/media/drivers/radiotrack.rst:42
msgid ""
"The RadioTrack card is an ISA 8-bit FM radio card.  The radio frequency (RF) "
"input is simply an antenna lead, and the output is a power audio signal "
"available through a miniature phone plug.  Its RF frequencies of operation "
"are more or less limited from 87.0 to 109.0 MHz (the commercial FM broadcast "
"band).  Although the registers can be programmed to request frequencies "
"beyond these limits, experiments did not give promising results.  The "
"variable frequency oscillator (VFO) that demodulates the intermediate "
"frequency (IF) signal probably has a small range of useful frequencies, and "
"wraps around or gets clipped beyond the limits mentioned above."

msgid ""
"The RadioTrack (base) ioport is configurable for 0x30c or 0x20c.  Only one "
"ioport seems to be involved.  The ioport decoding circuitry must be pretty "
"simple, as individual ioport bits are directly matched to specific functions "
"(or blocks) of the radio card.  This way, many functions can be changed in "
"parallel with one write to the ioport.  The only feedback available through "
"the ioports appears to be the \"Stereo Detect\" bit."
