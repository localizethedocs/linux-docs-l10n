"HDMI connectors provide a single pin for use by the Consumer Electronics "
"Control protocol. This protocol allows different devices connected by an "
"HDMI cable to communicate. The protocol for CEC version 1.4 is defined in "
"supplements 1 (CEC) and 2 (HEAC or HDMI Ethernet and Audio Return Channel) "
"of the HDMI 1.4a (:ref:`hdmi`) specification and the extensions added to CEC "
"version 2.0 are defined in chapter 11 of the HDMI 2.0 (:ref:`hdmi2`) "
"specification."

"The bitrate is very slow (effectively no more than 36 bytes per second) and "
"is based on the ancient AV.link protocol used in old SCART connectors. The "
"protocol closely resembles a crazy Rube Goldberg contraption and is an "
"unholy mix of low and high level messages. Some messages, especially those "
"part of the HEAC protocol layered on top of CEC, need to be handled by the "
"kernel, others can be handled either by the kernel or by userspace."

"In addition, CEC can be implemented in HDMI receivers, transmitters and in "
"USB devices that have an HDMI input and an HDMI output and that control just "
"the CEC pin."

"Drivers that support CEC will create a CEC device node (/dev/cecX) to give "
