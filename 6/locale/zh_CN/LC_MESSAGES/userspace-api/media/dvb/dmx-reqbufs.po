"Memory mapped buffers are located in device memory and must be allocated "
"with this ioctl before they can be mapped into the application's address "
"space. User buffers are allocated by applications themselves, and this ioctl "
"is merely used to switch the driver into user pointer I/O mode and to setup "
"some internal structures. Similarly, DMABUF buffers are allocated by "
"applications through a device driver, and this ioctl only configures the "
"driver into DMABUF I/O mode without performing any direct allocation."

"To allocate device buffers applications initialize all fields of the struct :"
"c:type:`dmx_requestbuffers` structure. They set the  ``count`` field to the "
"desired number of buffers,  and ``size`` to the size of each buffer."

"When the ioctl is called with a pointer to this structure, the driver will "
"attempt to allocate the requested number of buffers and it stores the actual "
"number allocated in the ``count`` field. The ``count`` can be smaller than "
"the number requested, even zero, when the driver runs out of free memory. A "
"larger number is also possible when the driver requires more buffers to "
"function correctly. The actual allocated buffer size can is returned at "
"``size``, and can be smaller than what's requested."
