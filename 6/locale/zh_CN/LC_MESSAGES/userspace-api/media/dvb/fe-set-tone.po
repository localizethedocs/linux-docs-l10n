"Usually, satellite antenna subsystems require that the digital TV device to "
"send a 22kHz tone in order to select between high/low band on some dual-band "
"LNBf. It is also used to send signals to DiSEqC equipment, but this is done "

"If more than one device is connected to the same antenna, setting a tone may "
"interfere on other devices, as they may lose the capability of selecting the "
"band. So, it is recommended that applications would change to SEC_TONE_OFF "
"when the device is not used."
