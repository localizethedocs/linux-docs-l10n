"Specifies to DW100 driver its dewarping map (aka LUT) blob as described in "
"*chapter 13.15.2.3 Dewarping Remap* of IMX8MP_ reference manual as an U32 "
"dynamic array. The image is divided into many small 16x16 blocks. If the "
"width/height of the image is not divisible by 16, the size of the rightmost/"
"bottommost block is the remainder. The dewarping map only saves the vertex "
"coordinates of the block. The dewarping grid map is comprised of vertex "
"coordinates for x and y. Each x, y coordinate register uses 16 bits (UQ12.4) "
"to record the coordinate address, with the Y coordinate in the upper bits "
"and X in the lower bits. The driver modifies the dimensions of this control "
"when the sink format is changed, to reflect the new input resolution."
