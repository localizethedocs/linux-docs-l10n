"The hardware may be able to detect the current DV timings automatically, "
"similar to sensing the video standard. To do so, applications call :ref:"
"`VIDIOC_QUERY_DV_TIMINGS` with a pointer to a struct :c:type:"
"`v4l2_dv_timings`. Once the hardware detects the timings, it will fill in "
"the timings structure."

msgid ""
"Drivers shall *not* switch timings automatically if new timings are "
"detected. Instead, drivers should send the ``V4L2_EVENT_SOURCE_CHANGE`` "
"event (if they support this) and expect that userspace will take action by "
"calling :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERY_DV_TIMINGS`. The reason is that new timings "
"usually mean different buffer sizes as well, and you cannot change buffer "
"sizes on the fly. In general, applications that receive the Source Change "
"event will have to call :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERY_DV_TIMINGS`, and if the detected "
"timings are valid they will have to stop streaming, set the new timings, "
"allocate new buffers and start streaming again."

"If the timings could not be detected because there was no signal, then "
"ENOLINK is returned. If a signal was detected, but it was unstable and the "
"receiver could not lock to the signal, then ``ENOLCK`` is returned. If the "
"receiver could lock to the signal, but the format is unsupported (e.g. "
"because the pixelclock is out of range of the hardware capabilities), then "
"the driver fills in whatever timings it could find and returns ``ERANGE``. "
"In that case the application can call :ref:`VIDIOC_DV_TIMINGS_CAP` to "
"compare the found timings with the hardware's capabilities in order to give "
"more precise feedback to the user."
