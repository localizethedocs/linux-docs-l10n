"Soon after the V4L API was added to the kernel it was criticised as too "
"inflexible. In August 1998 Bill Dirks proposed a number of improvements and "
"began to work on documentation, example drivers and applications. With the "
"help of other volunteers this eventually became the V4L2 API, not just an "
"extension but a replacement for the V4L API. However it took another four "
"years and two stable kernel releases until the new API was finally accepted "
"for inclusion into the kernel in its present form."

"UST (Unadjusted System Time). See http://web.archive.org/web/\\*/http://"
"reality.sgi.com /cpirazzi_engr/lg/time/intro.html. UST uses timestamps that "
"are 64-bit signed integers (not struct timeval's) and given in nanosecond "
"units. The UST clock starts at zero when the system is booted and runs "
"continuously and uniformly. It takes a little over 292 years for UST to "
"overflow. There is no way to set the UST clock. The regular Linux time-of-"
"day clock can be changed periodically, which would cause errors if it were "
"being used for timestamping a multimedia stream. A real UST style clock will "
"require some support in the kernel that is not there yet. But in "
"anticipation, I will change the timestamp field to a 64-bit integer, and I "
"will change the v4l2_masterclock_gettime() function (used only by drivers) "
