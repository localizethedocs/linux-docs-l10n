"VBI is an abbreviation of Vertical Blanking Interval, a gap in the sequence "
"of lines of an analog video signal. During VBI no picture information is "
"transmitted, allowing some time while the electron beam of a cathode ray "
"tube TV returns to the top of the screen. Using an oscilloscope you will "
"find here the vertical synchronization pulses and short data packages ASK "
"modulated [#f1]_ onto the video signal. These are transmissions of services "
"such as Teletext or Closed Caption."
