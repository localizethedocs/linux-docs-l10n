"There are two classes of clients, normal clients and supplicants. The latter "
"is a helper process for the TEE to access resources in Linux, for example "
"file system access. A normal client opens /dev/tee[0-9]* and a supplicant "
"opens /dev/teepriv[0-9]."

"Much of the communication between clients and the TEE is opaque to the "
"driver. The main job for the driver is to receive requests from the clients, "
"forward them to the TEE and send back the results. In the case of "
"supplicants the communication goes in the other direction, the TEE sends "
"requests to the supplicant which then sends back the result."
