"If you are a subsystem or branch maintainer, sometimes you need to slightly "
"modify patches you receive in order to merge them, because the code is not "
"exactly the same in your tree and the submitters'. If you stick strictly to "
"rule (c) of the developers certificate of origin, you should ask the "
"submitter to rediff, but this is a totally counter-productive waste of time "
"and energy. Rule (b) allows you to adjust the code, but then it is very "
"impolite to change one submitters code and make him endorse your bugs. To "
"solve this problem, it is recommended that you add a line between the last "
"Signed-off-by header and yours, indicating the nature of your changes. While "
"there is nothing mandatory about this, it seems like prepending the "
"description with your mail and/or name, all enclosed in square brackets, is "
"noticeable enough to make it obvious that you are responsible for last-"
"minute changes. Example::"

"This practice is particularly helpful if you maintain a stable branch and "
"want at the same time to credit the author, track changes, merge the fix, "
"and protect the submitter from complaints. Note that under no circumstances "
"can you change the author's identity (the From header), as it is the one "
"which appears in the changelog."

"Special note to back-porters: It seems to be a common and useful practice to "
"insert an indication of the origin of a patch at the top of the commit "
"message (just after the subject line) to facilitate tracking. For instance, "
"here's what we see in a 3.x-stable release::"
