"Linux provides many different input drivers for gamepad hardware. To avoid "

"Menu-Pad Different constellations, but most-times 2 buttons: SELECT - START "
"Furthermore, many gamepads have a fancy branded button that is used as "

"used to pop up system-menus or system-settings."

"All gamepads that follow the protocol described here map BTN_GAMEPAD. This "
"is an alias for BTN_SOUTH/BTN_A. It can be used to identify a gamepad as "
"such. However, not all gamepads provide all features, so you need to test "
"for all features that you need, first. How each feature is mapped is "
"described below."

"Legacy drivers often don't comply to these rules. As we cannot change them "
"for backwards-compatibility reasons, you need to provide fixup mappings in "
"user-space yourself. Some of them might also provide module-options that "

"There are a lot of less-featured/less-powerful devices out there, which re-"
"use the buttons from this protocol. However, they try to do this in a "
"compatible fashion. For example, the \"Nintendo Wii Nunchuk\" provides two "
"trigger buttons and one analog stick. It reports them as if it were a "
"gamepad with only one analog stick and two trigger buttons on the right "
"side. But that means, that if you only support \"real\" gamepads, you must "
"test devices for _all_ reported events that you need. Otherwise, you will "
"also get devices that report a small subset of the events."
