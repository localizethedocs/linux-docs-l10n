"This module is intended to try to make the lives of input driver developers "
"easier by allowing them to test various serio devices (mainly the various "
"touchpads found on laptops) without having to have the physical device in "
"front of them. userio accomplishes this by allowing any privileged userspace "
"program to directly interact with the kernel's serio driver and control a "
"virtual serio port from there."

"In order to interact with the userio kernel module, one simply opens the /"
"dev/userio character device in their applications. Commands are sent to the "
"kernel module by writing to the device, and any data received from the serio "
"driver is read as-is from the /dev/userio device. All of the structures and "
"macros you need to interact with the device are defined in <linux/userio.h> "
"and <linux/serio.h>."

msgid ""
"``type`` describes the type of command that is being sent. This can be any "
"one of the USERIO_CMD macros defined in <linux/userio.h>. ``data`` is the "
"argument that goes along with the command. In the event that the command "
"doesn't have an argument, this field can be left untouched and will be "
"ignored by the kernel. Each command should be sent by writing the struct "
"directly to the character device. In the event that the command you send is "
"invalid, an error will be returned by the character device and a more "
"descriptive error will be printed to the kernel log. Only one command can be "
"sent at a time, any additional data written to the character device after "
"the initial command will be ignored."
