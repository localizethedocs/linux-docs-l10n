msgid ""
"The Multi-Queue Block IO Queueing Mechanism is an API to enable fast storage "
"devices to achieve a huge number of input/output operations per second "
"(IOPS) through queueing and submitting IO requests to block devices "
"simultaneously, benefiting from the parallelism offered by modern storage "
"devices."

msgid ""
"Magnetic hard disks have been the de facto standard from the beginning of "
"the development of the kernel. The Block IO subsystem aimed to achieve the "
"best performance possible for those devices with a high penalty when doing "
"random access, and the bottleneck was the mechanical moving parts, a lot "
"slower than any layer on the storage stack. One example of such optimization "
"technique involves ordering read/write requests according to the current "
"position of the hard disk head."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:26
msgid ""
"However, with the development of Solid State Drives and Non-Volatile "
"Memories without mechanical parts nor random access penalty and capable of "
"performing high parallel access, the bottleneck of the stack had moved from "
"the storage device to the operating system. In order to take advantage of "
"the parallelism in those devices' design, the multi-queue mechanism was "
"introduced."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:32
msgid ""
"The former design had a single queue to store block IO requests with a "
"single lock. That did not scale well in SMP systems due to dirty data in "
"cache and the bottleneck of having a single lock for multiple processors. "
"This setup also suffered with congestion when different processes (or the "
"same process, moving to different CPUs) wanted to perform block IO. Instead "
"of this, the blk-mq API spawns multiple queues with individual entry points "
"local to the CPU, removing the need for a lock. A deeper explanation on how "
"this works is covered in the following section (`Operation`_)."

msgid "Operation"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:44
msgid ""
"When the userspace performs IO to a block device (reading or writing a file, "
"for instance), blk-mq takes action: it will store and manage IO requests to "
"the block device, acting as middleware between the userspace (and a file "
"system, if present) and the block device driver."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:49
msgid ""
"blk-mq has two group of queues: software staging queues and hardware "
"dispatch queues. When the request arrives at the block layer, it will try "
"the shortest path possible: send it directly to the hardware queue. However, "
"there are two cases that it might not do that: if there's an IO scheduler "
"attached at the layer or if we want to try to merge requests. In both cases, "
"requests will be sent to the software queue."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:56
msgid ""
"Then, after the requests are processed by software queues, they will be "
"placed at the hardware queue, a second stage queue where the hardware has "
"direct access to process those requests. However, if the hardware does not "
"have enough resources to accept more requests, blk-mq will place requests on "
"a temporary queue, to be sent in the future, when the hardware is able."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:63
msgid "Software staging queues"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:65
msgid ""
"The block IO subsystem adds requests in the software staging queues "
"(represented by struct blk_mq_ctx) in case that they weren't sent directly "
"to the driver. A request is one or more BIOs. They arrived at the block "
"layer through the data structure struct bio. The block layer will then build "
"a new structure from it, the struct request that will be used to communicate "
"with the device driver. Each queue has its own lock and the number of queues "
"is defined by a per-CPU or per-node basis."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:73
msgid ""
"The staging queue can be used to merge requests for adjacent sectors. For "
"instance, requests for sector 3-6, 6-7, 7-9 can become one request for 3-9. "
"Even if random access to SSDs and NVMs have the same time of response "
"compared to sequential access, grouped requests for sequential access "
"decreases the number of individual requests. This technique of merging "
"requests is called plugging."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:80
msgid ""
"Along with that, the requests can be reordered to ensure fairness of system "
"resources (e.g. to ensure that no application suffers from starvation) and/"
"or to improve IO performance, by an IO scheduler."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:85
msgid "IO Schedulers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:87
msgid ""
"There are several schedulers implemented by the block layer, each one "
"following a heuristic to improve the IO performance. They are "
"\"pluggable\" (as in plug and play), in the sense of they can be selected at "
"run time using sysfs. You can read more about Linux's IO schedulers `here "
"<https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/block/index.html>`_. The scheduling "
"happens only between requests in the same queue, so it is not possible to "
"merge requests from different queues, otherwise there would be cache "
"trashing and a need to have a lock for each queue. After the scheduling, the "
"requests are eligible to be sent to the hardware. One of the possible "
"schedulers to be selected is the NONE scheduler, the most straightforward "
"one. It will just place requests on whatever software queue the process is "
"running on, without any reordering. When the device starts processing "
"requests in the hardware queue (a.k.a. run the hardware queue), the software "
"queues mapped to that hardware queue will be drained in sequence according "
"to their mapping."

msgid "Hardware dispatch queues"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:105
msgid ""
"The hardware queue (represented by struct blk_mq_hw_ctx) is a struct used by "
"device drivers to map the device submission queues (or device DMA ring "
"buffer), and are the last step of the block layer submission code before the "
"low level device driver taking ownership of the request. To run this queue, "
"the block layer removes requests from the associated software queues and "
"tries to dispatch to the hardware."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:112
msgid ""
"If it's not possible to send the requests directly to hardware, they will be "
"added to a linked list (``hctx->dispatch``) of requests. Then, next time the "
"block layer runs a queue, it will send the requests laying at the "
"``dispatch`` list first, to ensure a fairness dispatch with those requests "
"that were ready to be sent first. The number of hardware queues depends on "
"the number of hardware contexts supported by the hardware and its device "
"driver, but it will not be more than the number of cores of the system. "
"There is no reordering at this stage, and each software queue has a set of "
"hardware queues to send requests for."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../block/blk-mq.rst:124

"Neither the block layer nor the device protocols guarantee the order of "
"completion of requests. This must be handled by higher layers, like the "

"In order to indicate which request has been completed, every request is "
"identified by an integer, ranging from 0 to the dispatch queue size. This "
"tag is generated by the block layer and later reused by the device driver, "
"removing the need to create a redundant identifier. When a request is "
"completed in the driver, the tag is sent back to the block layer to notify "
"it of the finalization. This removes the need to do a linear search to find "
"out which IO has been completed."
