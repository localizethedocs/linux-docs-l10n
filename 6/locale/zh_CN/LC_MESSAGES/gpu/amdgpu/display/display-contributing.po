msgid ""
"The Ftrace debug feature (check 'Documentation/trace/ftrace.rst') is a "
"fantastic way to check the code path when developers try to make sense of a "
"bug. Ftrace provides a filter mechanism that can be useful when the "
"developer has some hunch of which part of the code can cause the issue; for "
"this reason, if a set of functions has a proper prefix, it becomes easy to "
"create a good filter. Additionally, prefixes can improve stack trace "
"readability."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../gpu/amdgpu/display/display-contributing.rst:77
msgid ""
"The DC code does not follow some prefix rules, which makes the Ftrace filter "
"more complicated and reduces the readability of the stack trace. If you want "
"something simple to start contributing to the display, you can make patches "
"for adding prefixes to DC functions. To create those prefixes, use part of "
"the file name as a prefix for all functions in the target file. Check the "
"'amdgpu_dm_crtc.c` and `amdgpu_dm_plane.c` for some references. However, we "
"strongly advise not to send huge patches changing these prefixes; otherwise, "
"it will be hard to review and test, which can generate second thoughts from "
"maintainers. Try small steps; in case of double, you can ask before you put "
"in effort. We recommend first looking at folders like dceXYZ, dcnXYZ, "
"basics, bios, core, clk_mgr, hwss, resource, and irq."

"AMD has an extensive portfolio with various dGPUs and APUs that amdgpu "

"in a modular design, making the bring-up for new hardware fast. Over the "

"duplication (including patterns) and use it as guidance to reduce "
"duplications."
