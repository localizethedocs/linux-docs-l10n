"The DS2438 chip provides several functions that are desirable to carry in a "
"battery pack. It also has a 40 bytes of nonvolatile EEPROM. Because the "
"ability of temperature, current and voltage measurement, the chip is also "
"often used in weather stations and applications such as: rain gauge, wind "
"speed/direction measuring, humidity sensing, etc."
