"This LED trigger can be used for signalling to the user a presence of USB "
"device in a given port. It simply turns on LED when device appears and turns "
"it off when it disappears."

"It requires selecting USB ports that should be observed. All available ones "
"are listed as separated entries in a \"ports\" subdirectory. Selecting is "
"handled by echoing \"1\" to a chosen port."

"Please note that this trigger allows selecting multiple USB ports for a "
"single LED."

"In such a case LED will be turned on as long as there is at least one "
"connected USB device."

msgid ""
"Some devices may have one controller per PHY standard. E.g. USB 3.0 physical "
"port may be handled by ohci-platform, ehci-platform and xhci-hcd. If there "
"is only one LED user will most likely want to assign ports from all 3 hubs."
