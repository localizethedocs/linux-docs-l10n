"NetLabel is a mechanism which can set and retrieve security attributes from "
"network packets.  It is intended to be used by LSM developers who want to "
"make use of a common code base for several different packet labeling "
"protocols. The NetLabel security module API is defined in 'include/net/"
"netlabel.h' but a brief overview is given below."

"Since NetLabel supports multiple different packet labeling protocols and "
"LSMs it uses the concept of security attributes to refer to the packet's "
"security labels.  The NetLabel security attributes are defined by the "
"'netlbl_lsm_secattr' structure in the NetLabel header file.  Internally the "
"NetLabel subsystem converts the security attributes to and from the correct "
"low-level packet label depending on the NetLabel build time and run time "
"configuration.  It is up to the LSM developer to translate the NetLabel "
"security attributes into whatever security identifiers are in use for their "
"particular LSM."

"These are the functions which allow the LSM developer to manipulate the "
"labels on outgoing packets as well as read the labels on incoming packets.  "
"Functions exist to operate both on sockets as well as the sk_buffs "
"directly.  These high level functions are translated into low level protocol "
"operations based on how the administrator has configured the NetLabel "
"subsystem."

"Depending on the exact configuration, translation between the network packet "
"label and the internal LSM security identifier can be time consuming.  The "
"NetLabel label mapping cache is a caching mechanism which can be used to "
"sidestep much of this overhead once a mapping has been established.  Once "
"the LSM has received a packet, used NetLabel to decode its security "
"attributes, and translated the security attributes into a LSM internal "
"identifier the LSM can use the NetLabel caching functions to associate the "
"LSM internal identifier with the network packet's label.  This means that in "
"the future when a incoming packet matches a cached value not only are the "
"internal NetLabel translation mechanisms bypassed but the LSM translation "
"mechanisms are bypassed as well which should result in a significant "
"reduction in overhead."
