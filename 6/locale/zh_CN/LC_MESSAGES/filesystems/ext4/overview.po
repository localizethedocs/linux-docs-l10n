"An ext4 file system is split into a series of block groups. To reduce "
"performance difficulties due to fragmentation, the block allocator tries "
"very hard to keep each file's blocks within the same group, thereby reducing "
"seek times. The size of a block group is specified in ``sb."
"s_blocks_per_group`` blocks, though it can also calculated as 8 * "
"``block_size_in_bytes``. With the default block size of 4KiB, each group "
"will contain 32,768 blocks, for a length of 128MiB. The number of block "
"groups is the size of the device divided by the size of a block group."

"All fields in ext4 are written to disk in little-endian order. HOWEVER, all "
"fields in jbd2 (the journal) are written to disk in big-endian order."
