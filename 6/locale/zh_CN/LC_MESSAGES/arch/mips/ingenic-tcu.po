"The Timer/Counter Unit (TCU) in Ingenic JZ47xx SoCs is a multi-function "
"hardware block. It features up to eight channels, that can be used as "
"counters, timers, or PWM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/mips/ingenic-tcu.rst:11
msgid ""
"JZ4725B, JZ4750, JZ4755 only have six TCU channels. The other SoCs all have "
"eight channels."

#: ../../../arch/mips/ingenic-tcu.rst:14
msgid ""
"JZ4725B introduced a separate channel, called Operating System Timer (OST). "
"It is a 32-bit programmable timer. On JZ4760B and above, it is 64-bit."

"Each one of the TCU channels has its own clock, which can be reparented to "
"three different clocks (pclk, ext, rtc), gated, and reclocked, through their "
"TCSR register."

"The watchdog and OST hardware blocks also feature a TCSR register with the "
"same format in their register space."

"The TCU registers used to gate/ungate can also gate/ungate the watchdog and "
