"Most recent Chromebooks that use device tree are using the opensource "
"depthcharge_ bootloader. Depthcharge_ expects the OS to be packaged as a "
"`FIT Image`_ which contains an OS image as well as a collection of device "
"trees. It is up to depthcharge_ to pick the right device tree from the `FIT "
"Image`_ and provide it to the OS."

"In general when any significant changes are made to a board the board "

"It should be noted that, taking into account the above system that "

"and try to run old software on it then we'll at pick the newest device tree "
