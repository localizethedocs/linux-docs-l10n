"AMD Heterogeneous Core implementations are comprised of more than one "
"architectural class and CPUs are comprised of cores of various efficiency "
"and power capabilities: performance-oriented *classic cores* and power-"
"efficient *dense cores*. As such, power management strategies must be "
"designed to accommodate the complexities introduced by incorporating "
"different core types. Heterogeneous systems can also extend to more than two "
"architectural classes as well. The purpose of the scheduling feedback "
"mechanism is to provide information to the operating system scheduler in "
"real time such that the scheduler can direct threads to the optimal core."

"The goal of AMD's heterogeneous architecture is to attain power benefit by "
"sending background threads to the dense cores while sending high priority "
"threads to the classic cores. From a performance perspective, sending "
"background threads to dense cores can free up power headroom and allow the "
"classic cores to optimally service demanding threads. Furthermore, the area "
"optimized nature of the dense cores allows for an increasing number of "
"physical cores. This improved core density will have positive multithreaded "
"performance impact."
