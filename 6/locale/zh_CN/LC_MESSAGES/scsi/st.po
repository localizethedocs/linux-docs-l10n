"The driver is generic, i.e., it does not contain any code tailored to any "
"specific tape drive. The tape parameters can be specified with one of the "
"following three methods:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:21
msgid ""
"1. Each user can specify the tape parameters he/she wants to use directly "
"with ioctls. This is administratively a very simple and flexible method and "
"applicable to single-user workstations. However, in a multiuser environment "
"the next user finds the tape parameters in state the previous user left them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:27
msgid ""
"2. The system manager (root) can define default values for some tape "
"parameters, like block size and density using the MTSETDRVBUFFER ioctl. "
"These parameters can be programmed to come into effect either when a new "
"tape is loaded into the drive or if writing begins at the beginning of the "
"tape. The second method is applicable if the tape drive performs auto-"
"detection of the tape format well (like some QIC-drives). The result is that "
"any tape can be read, writing can be continued using existing format, and "
"the default format is used if the tape is rewritten from the beginning (or a "
"new tape is written for the first time). The first method is applicable if "
"the drive does not perform auto-detection well enough and there is a single "
"\"sensible\" mode for the device. An example is a DAT drive that is used "
"only in variable block mode (I don't know if this is sensible or not :-)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:42
msgid ""
"The user can override the parameters defined by the system manager. The "
"changes persist until the defaults again come into effect."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:46
msgid ""
"3. By default, up to four modes can be defined and selected using the minor "
"number (bits 5 and 6). The number of modes can be changed by changing "
"ST_NBR_MODE_BITS in st.h. Mode 0 corresponds to the defaults discussed "
"above. Additional modes are dormant until they are defined by the system "
"manager (root). When specification of a new mode is started, the "
"configuration of mode 0 is used to provide a starting point for definition "
"of the new mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:54
msgid ""
"Using the modes allows the system manager to give the users choices over "
"some of the buffering parameters not directly accessible to the users "
"(buffered and asynchronous writes). The modes also allow choices between "
"formats in multi-tape operations (the explicitly overridden parameters are "
"reset when a new tape is loaded)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:60
msgid ""
"If more than one mode is used, all modes should contain definitions for the "
"same set of parameters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:63
msgid ""
"Many Unices contain internal tables that associate different modes to "
"supported devices. The Linux SCSI tape driver does not contain such tables "
"(and will not do that in future). Instead of that, a utility program can be "
"made that fetches the inquiry data sent by the device, scans its database, "
"and sets up the modes using the ioctls. Another alternative is to make a "
"small script that uses mt to set the defaults tailored to the system."

"The driver supports fixed and variable block size (within buffer limits). "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:75
msgid ""
"In variable block mode, the byte count in write() determines the size of the "
"physical block on tape. When reading, the drive reads the next tape block "
"and returns to the user the data if the read() byte count is at least the "
"block size. Otherwise, error ENOMEM is returned."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:80
msgid ""
"In fixed block mode, the data transfer between the drive and the driver is "
"in multiples of the block size. The write() byte count must be a multiple of "
"the block size. This is not required when reading but may be advisable for "
"portability."

"Support is provided for changing the tape partition and partitioning of the "
"tape with one or two partitions. By default support for partitioned tape is "
"disabled for each driver and it can be enabled with the ioctl MTSETDRVBUFFER."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:90
msgid ""
"By default the driver writes one filemark when the device is closed after "
"writing and the last operation has been a write. Two filemarks can be "
"optionally written. In both cases end of data is signified by returning zero "
"bytes for two consecutive reads."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../scsi/st.rst:95
msgid ""
"Writing filemarks without the immediate bit set in the SCSI command block "
"acts as a synchronization point, i.e., all remaining data form the drive "
"buffers is written to tape before the command returns. This makes sure that "
"write errors are caught at that point, but this takes time. In some "
"applications, several consecutive files must be written fast. The MTWEOFI "
"operation can be used to write the filemarks without flushing the drive "
"buffer. Writing filemark at close() is always flushing the drive buffers. "
"However, if the previous operation is MTWEOFI, close() does not write a "
"filemark. This can be used if the program wants to close/open the tape "
"device between files and wants to skip waiting."
