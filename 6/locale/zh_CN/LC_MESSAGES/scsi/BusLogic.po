"BusLogic, Inc. designed and manufactured a variety of high performance SCSI "
"host adapters which share a common programming interface across a diverse "
"collection of bus architectures by virtue of their MultiMaster ASIC "
"technology. BusLogic was acquired by Mylex Corporation in February 1996, but "
"the products supported by this driver originated under the BusLogic name and "
"so that name is retained in the source code and documentation."

"This driver supports all present BusLogic MultiMaster Host Adapters, and "
"should support any future MultiMaster designs with little or no "
"modification.  More recently, BusLogic introduced the FlashPoint Host "
"Adapters, which are less costly and rely on the host CPU, rather than "
"including an onboard processor. Despite not having an onboard CPU, the "
"FlashPoint Host Adapters perform very well and have very low command "
"latency.  BusLogic has recently provided me with the FlashPoint Driver "
"Developer's Kit, which comprises documentation and freely redistributable "
"source code for the FlashPoint SCCB Manager.  The SCCB Manager is the "
"library of code that runs on the host CPU and performs functions analogous "
"to the firmware on the MultiMaster Host Adapters.  Thanks to their having "
"provided the SCCB Manager, this driver now supports the FlashPoint Host "
"Adapters as well."

"My primary goals in writing this completely new BusLogic driver for Linux "

"driver that can be depended upon for high performance mission critical "
"applications.  All of the major performance features can be configured from "

"BusLogic SCSI Host Adapters directly implement SCSI-2 Tagged Queuing, and so "
"support has been included in the driver to utilize tagged queuing with any "
"target devices that report having the tagged queuing capability.  Tagged "
"queuing allows for multiple outstanding commands to be issued to each target "
"device or logical unit, and can improve I/O performance substantially.  In "
"addition, BusLogic's Strict Round Robin Mode is used to optimize host "
"adapter performance, and scatter/gather I/O can support as many segments as "
"can be effectively utilized by the Linux I/O subsystem.  Control over the "
"use of tagged queuing for each target device as well as individual selection "
"of the tagged queue depth is available through driver options provided on "
"the kernel command line or at module initialization time.  By default, the "
"queue depth is determined automatically based on the host adapter's total "
"queue depth and the number, type, speed, and capabilities of the target "
"devices found.  In addition, tagged queuing is automatically disabled "
"whenever the host adapter firmware version is known not to implement it "
"correctly, or whenever a tagged queue depth of 1 is selected.  Tagged "
"queuing is also disabled for individual target devices if disconnect/"
"reconnect is disabled for that device."

"The driver implements extensive error recovery procedures.  When the higher "
"level parts of the SCSI subsystem request that a timed out command be reset, "
"a selection is made between a full host adapter hard reset and SCSI bus "
"reset versus sending a bus device reset message to the individual target "
"device based on the recommendation of the SCSI subsystem.  Error recovery "
"strategies are selectable through driver options individually for each "
"target device, and also include sending a bus device reset to the specific "
"target device associated with the command being reset, as well as "
"suppressing error recovery entirely to avoid perturbing an improperly "
"functioning device.  If the bus device reset error recovery strategy is "
"selected and sending a bus device reset does not restore correct operation, "
"the next command that is reset will force a full host adapter hard reset and "
"SCSI bus reset.  SCSI bus resets caused by other devices and detected by the "
"host adapter are also handled by issuing a soft reset to the host adapter "
"and re-initialization. Finally, if tagged queuing is active and more than "
"one command reset occurs in a 10 minute interval, or if a command reset "
"occurs within the first 10 minutes of operation, then tagged queuing will be "
"disabled for that target device.  These error recovery options improve "
"overall system robustness by preventing individual errant devices from "
"causing the system as a whole to lock up or crash, and thereby allowing a "
"clean shutdown and restart after the offending component is removed."
