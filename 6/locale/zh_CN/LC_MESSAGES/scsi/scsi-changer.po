"First some words about how changers work: A changer has 2 (possibly more) "
"SCSI ID's. One for the changer device which controls the robot, and one for "
"the device which actually reads and writes the data. The later may be "
"anything, a MOD, a CD-ROM, a tape or whatever. For the changer device this "
"is a \"don't care\", he *only* shuffles around the media, nothing else."

#: ../../../scsi/scsi-changer.rst:53
msgid ""
"I implemented the driver as character device driver with a NetBSD-like ioctl "
"interface. Just grabbed NetBSD's header file and one of the other linux SCSI "
"device drivers as starting point. The interface should be source code "
"compatible with NetBSD. So if there is any software (anybody knows ???) "
"which supports a BSDish changer driver, it should work with this driver too."

#: ../../../scsi/scsi-changer.rst:60

"Over time a few more ioctls where added, volume tag support for example "

"I test and use the driver myself with a 35 slot cdrom jukebox from Grundig.  "
"I got some reports telling it works ok with tape autoloaders (Exabyte, HP "
"and DEC).  Some People use this driver with amanda.  It works fine with "
"small (11 slots) and a huge (4 MOs, 88 slots) magneto-optical Jukebox.  "
"Probably with lots of other changers too, most (but not all :-) people mail "
"me only if it does *not* work..."

"I don't have any device lists, neither black-list nor white-list.  Thus it "
"is quite useless to ask me whenever a specific device is supported or not.  "
"In theory every changer device which supports the SCSI-2 media changer "
"command set should work out-of-the-box with this driver.  If it doesn't, it "
"is a bug.  Either within the driver or within the firmware of the changer "
"device."
