"The LM93 hardware monitor has a two wire digital interface compatible with "
"SMBus 2.0. Using an 8-bit ADC, the LM93 measures the temperature of two "
"remote diode connected transistors as well as its own die and 16 power "
"supply voltages. To set fan speed, the LM93 has two PWM outputs that are "
"each controlled by up to four temperature zones. The fancontrol algorithm is "
"lookup table based. The LM93 includes a digital filter that can be invoked "
"to smooth temperature readings for better control of fan speed. The LM93 has "
"four tachometer inputs to measure fan speed. Limit and status registers for "
"all measured values are included. The LM93 builds upon the functionality of "
"previous motherboard management ASICs and uses some of the LM85's features "
"(i.e. smart tachometer mode). It also adds measurement and control support "
"for dynamic Vccp monitoring and PROCHOT. It is designed to monitor a dual "
"processor Xeon class motherboard with a minimum of external components."
