"The driver implements a simple interface for driving a fan connected to a "
"PWM output and tachometer inputs. This driver obtains PWM and tachometers "
"registers location according to the system configuration and creates FAN/PWM "
"hwmon objects and a cooling device. PWM and tachometers are sensed through "
"the on-board programmable device, which exports its register map. This "
"device could be attached to any bus type, for which register mapping is "
"supported. Single instance is created with one PWM control, up to 12 "
"tachometers and one cooling device. It could be as many instances as "
"programmable device supports. The driver exposes the fan to the user space "
"through the hwmon's and thermal's sysfs interfaces."
