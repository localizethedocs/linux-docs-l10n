"The chips support up to 25 temperature monitoring sources. Up to 6 of those "
"are direct temperature sensor inputs, the others are special sources such as "
"PECI, PCH, and SMBUS. Depending on the chip type, 2 to 6 of the temperature "
"sources can be monitored and compared against minimum, maximum, and critical "
"temperatures. The driver reports up to 10 of the temperatures to the user. "
"There are 4 to 5 fan rotation speed sensors, 8 to 15 analog voltage sensors, "
"one VID, alarms with beep warnings (control unimplemented), and some "
"automatic fan regulation strategies (plus manual fan control mode)."

"Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is "

"16, 32, 64 or 128) to give the readings more range or accuracy; the other "
"chips do not have a fan speed divider. The driver sets the most suitable fan "
"divisor itself; specifically, it increases the divider value each time a fan "
"speed reading returns an invalid value, and it reduces it if the fan speed "
"reading is lower than optimal. Some fans might not be present because they "
