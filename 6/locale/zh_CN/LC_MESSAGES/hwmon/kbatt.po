"The KEBA battery monitoring controller is an IP core for FPGAs, which "
"monitors the health of a coin cell battery. The coin cell battery is "
"typically used to supply the RTC during power off to keep the current time. "
"E.g., the CP500 FPGA includes this IP core to monitor the coin cell battery "
"of PLCs and the corresponding cp500 driver creates an auxiliary device for "
"the kbatt driver."

"This driver provides information about the coin cell battery health to user "
"space. Actually the user space shall be informed that the coin cell battery "
"is nearly empty and needs to be replaced."

"The coin cell battery must be tested actively to get to know if its nearly "
"empty or not. Therefore, a load is put on the coin cell battery and the "
"resulting voltage is evaluated. This evaluation is done by some hard wired "
"analog logic, which compares the voltage to a defined limit. If the voltage "
"is above the limit, then the coin cell battery is assumed to be ok. If the "
"voltage is below the limit, then the coin cell battery is nearly empty (or "
"broken, removed, ...) and shall be replaced by a new one. The KEBA battery "
"monitoring controller allows to start the test of the coin cell battery and "
"to get the result if the voltage is above or below the limit. The actual "
"voltage is not available. Only the information if the voltage is below a "
"limit is available."

"The test load, which is put on the coin cell battery for the health check, "
"is similar to the load during power off. Therefore, the lifetime of the coin "
"cell battery is reduced directly by the duration of each test. To limit the "
"negative impact to the lifetime the test is limited to at most once every 10 "
"seconds. The test load is put on the coin cell battery for 100ms. Thus, in "
"worst case the coin cell battery lifetime is reduced by 1% of the uptime or "
"3.65 days per year. As the coin cell battery lasts multiple years, this "
"lifetime reduction negligible."
