"This driver implements support for the Analog Devices ADT7470 chip.  There "
"may be other chips that implement this interface."

"The ADT7470 uses the 2-wire interface compatible with the SMBus 2.0 "
"specification. Using an analog to digital converter it measures up to ten "
"(10) external temperatures. It has four (4) 16-bit counters for measuring "
"fan speed. There are four (4) PWM outputs that can be used to control fan "
"speed."

#: ../../../hwmon/adt7470.rst:27
msgid ""
"A sophisticated control system for the PWM outputs is designed into the "
"ADT7470 that allows fan speed to be adjusted automatically based on any of "
"the ten temperature sensors. Each PWM output is individually adjustable and "
"programmable. Once configured, the ADT7470 will adjust the PWM outputs in "
"response to the measured temperatures with further host intervention.  This "
"feature can also be disabled for manual control of the PWM's."

"Each of the measured inputs (temperature, fan speed) has corresponding high/"
"low limit values. The ADT7470 will signal an ALARM if any measured value "
"exceeds either limit."

msgid ""
"The ADT7470 samples all inputs continuously.  A kernel thread is started up "
"for the purpose of periodically querying the temperature sensors, thus "
"allowing the automatic fan pwm control to set the fan speed.  The driver "
"will not read the registers more often than once every 5 seconds.  Further, "
"configuration data is only read once per minute."
