"The TC654 uses the 2-wire interface compatible with the SMBUS 2.0 "
"specification. The TC654 has two (2) inputs for measuring fan RPM and one "
"(1) PWM output which can be used for fan control."

"Ordinarily the pwm1_mode ABI is used for controlling the pwm output mode.  "
"However, for this chip the output is always pwm, and the pwm1_mode "
"determines if the pwm output is controlled via the pwm1 value or via the Vin "
"analog input."

"Setting pwm1_mode to 1 will cause the pwm output to be driven based on the "
"pwm1 value. Setting pwm1_mode to 0 will cause the pwm output to be driven "
"based on the Vin input."
