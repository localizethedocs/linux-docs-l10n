"LM95235 and LM95245 are 11-bit digital temperature sensors with a 2-wire "
"System Management Bus (SMBus) interface and TruTherm technology that can "
"monitor the temperature of a remote diode as well as its own temperature. "
"The chips can be used to very accurately monitor the temperature of external "
"devices such as microprocessors."

"All temperature values are given in millidegrees Celsius. Local temperature "
"is given within a range of -127 to +127.875 degrees. Remote temperatures are "
"given within a range of -127 to +255 degrees. Resolution depends on "
"temperature input and range."

"Each sensor has its own critical limit. Additionally, there is a relative "
"hysteresis value common to both critical limits. To make life easier to user-"
"space applications, two absolute values are exported, one for each channel, "
"but these values are of course linked. Only the local hysteresis can be set "
"from user-space, and the same delta applies to the remote hysteresis."

"The lm95245 driver can change its update interval to a fixed set of values. "
"It will round up to the next selectable interval. See the datasheet for "
"exact values. Reading sensor values more often will do no harm, but will "
"return 'old' values."
