"SMSC SCH5636 Super I/O chips include an embedded microcontroller for "
"hardware monitoring solutions, allowing motherboard manufacturers to create "
"their own custom hwmon solution based upon the SCH5636."

"Currently the sch5636 driver only supports the Fujitsu Theseus SCH5636 based "
"hwmon solution. The sch5636 driver runs a sanity check on loading to ensure "
"it is dealing with a Fujitsu Theseus and not with another custom SCH5636 "
"based hwmon solution."

"The Fujitsu Theseus can monitor up to 5 voltages, 8 fans and 16 "
"temperatures. Note that the driver detects how many fan headers / "
"temperature sensors are actually implemented on the motherboard, so you will "
"likely see fewer temperature and fan inputs."
