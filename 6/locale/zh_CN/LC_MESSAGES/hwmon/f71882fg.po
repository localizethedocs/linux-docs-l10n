"Fintek F718xx/F8000 Super I/O chips include complete hardware monitoring "

"Both PWM (pulse-width modulation) and DC fan speed control methods are "
"supported. The right one to use depends on external circuitry on the "
"motherboard, so the driver assumes that the BIOS set the method properly."

"Note that the lowest numbered temperature zone trip point corresponds to the "
"border between the highest and one but highest temperature zones, and vica "
"versa. So the temperature zone trip points 1-4 (or 1-2) go from high temp to "
"low temp! This is how things are implemented in the IC, and the driver "
"mimics this."

"There are 2 modes to specify the speed of the fan, PWM duty cycle (or DC "
"voltage) mode, where 0-100% duty cycle (0-100% of 12V) is specified. And RPM "
"mode where the actual RPM of the fan (as measured) is controlled and the "
"speed gets specified as 0-100% of the fan#_full_speed file."

"Since both modes work in a 0-100% (mapped to 0-255) scale, there isn't a "
"whole lot of a difference when modifying fan control settings. The only "
"important difference is that in RPM mode the 0-100% controls the fan speed "
"between 0-100% of fan#_full_speed. It is assumed that if the BIOS programs "
"RPM mode, it will also set fan#_full_speed properly, if it does not then fan "
"control will not work properly, unless you set a sane fan#_full_speed value "
"yourself."

"Three different fan control modes are supported; the mode number is written "

"2: Normal auto mode You can define a number of temperature/fan speed trip "
