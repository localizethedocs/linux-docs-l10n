msgid ""
"This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor LM78, LM78-J "
"and LM79. They are described as 'Microprocessor System Hardware Monitors'."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm78.rst:37
msgid ""
"There is almost no difference between the three supported chips. "
"Functionally, the LM78 and LM78-J are exactly identical. The LM79 has one "
"more VID line, which is used to report the lower voltages newer Pentium "
"processors use. From here on, LM7* means either of these three types."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm78.rst:42
msgid ""
"The LM7* implements one temperature sensor, three fan rotation speed "
"sensors, seven voltage sensors, VID lines, alarms, and some miscellaneous "
"stuff."

"Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. An alarm is triggered once "
"when the Overtemperature Shutdown limit is crossed; it is triggered again as "
"soon as it drops below the Hysteresis value. A more useful behavior can be "
"found by setting the Hysteresis value to +127 degrees Celsius; in this case, "
"alarms are issued during all the time when the actual temperature is above "
"the Overtemperature Shutdown value. Measurements are guaranteed between -55 "
"and +125 degrees, with a resolution of 1 degree."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm78.rst:53
msgid ""
"Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is "
"triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. Fan "
"readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4 or 8) to give the "
"readings more range or accuracy. Not all RPM values can accurately be "
"represented, so some rounding is done. With a divider of 2, the lowest "
"representable value is around 2600 RPM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm78.rst:60
msgid ""
"Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in volts. An "
"alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum or "
"maximum limit. Note that minimum in this case always means 'closest to "
"zero'; this is important for negative voltage measurements. All voltage "
"inputs can measure voltages between 0 and 4.08 volts, with a resolution of "
"0.016 volt."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm78.rst:67
msgid ""
"The VID lines encode the core voltage value: the voltage level your "
"processor should work with. This is hardcoded by the mainboard and/or "
"processor itself. It is a value in volts. When it is unconnected, you will "
"often find the value 3.50 V here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm78.rst:72
msgid ""
"If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register "
"is read at least once. This means that the cause for the alarm may already "
"have disappeared! Note that in the current implementation, all hardware "
"registers are read whenever any data is read (unless it is less than 1.5 "
"seconds since the last update). This means that you can easily miss once-"
"only alarms."

"The LM7* only updates its values each 1.5 seconds; reading it more often "
"will do no harm, but will return 'old' values."
