"To instantiate this driver on an AMD CPU with SB-RMI support, the i2c bus "
"number would be the bus connected from the board management controller (BMC) "
"to the CPU. The SMBus address is really 7 bits. Some vendors and the SMBus "
"specification show the address as 8 bits, left justified with the R/W bit as "
"a write (0) making bit 0. Some vendors use only the 7 bits to describe the "
"address. As mentioned in AMD's APML specification, The SB-RMI address is "
"normally 78h(0111 100W) or 3Ch(011 1100) for socket 0 and 70h(0111 000W) or "
"38h(011 1000) for socket 1, but it could vary based on hardware address "
"select pins."
