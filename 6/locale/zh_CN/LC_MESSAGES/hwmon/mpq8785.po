"The MPM3695 family is a scalable, ultra-thin, fully integrated power module "
"with a PMBus interface. It offers a complete power solution that achieves up "
"to 10A (-10 variant), 20A (-25 variant), 25A (-20 variant), 100A (-100 "
"variant) of output current with excellent load and line regulation across a "
"wide input voltage range. It operates at high efficiency over a wide load "
"range, and can be parallled to deliver higher current. Variants -10,-20 and "
"-100 have different voltage scale configuration register range (10 bits) "
"than -25 version (11 bits)."

"The MPM82504 is a quad 25A, scalable, fully integrated power module with a "
"PMBus interface. The device offers a complete power solution that achieves "
"up to 25A per output channel. The MPM82504 has four output channels that can "
"be paralleled to provide 50A, 75A, or 100A of output current for flexible "
"configurations. The device can also operate in parallel with the MPM3695-100 "
"and additional MPM82504 devices to provide a higher output current. The "
"MPM82504 operates at high efficiency across a wide load range."
