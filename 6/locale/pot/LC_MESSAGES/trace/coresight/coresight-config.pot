"The CoreSight System Configuration manager is an API that allows the "

"Many CoreSight components can be programmed in complex ways - especially "
"ETMs. In addition, components can interact across the CoreSight system, "
"often via the cross trigger components such as CTI and CTM. These system "
"settings can be defined and enabled as named configurations."

msgid ""
"A feature is a named set of programming for a CoreSight device. The "
"programming is device dependent, and can be defined in terms of absolute "
"register values, resource usage and parameter values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/coresight/coresight-config.rst:36
msgid ""
"The feature is defined using a descriptor. This descriptor is used to load "
"onto a matching device, either when the feature is loaded into the system, "
"or when the CoreSight device is registered with the configuration manager."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/coresight/coresight-config.rst:40
msgid ""
"The load process involves interpreting the descriptor into a set of register "
"accesses in the driver - the resource usage and parameter descriptions "
"translated into appropriate register accesses. This interpretation makes it "
"easy and efficient for the feature to be programmed onto the device when "
"required."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/coresight/coresight-config.rst:45
msgid ""
"The feature will not be active on the device until the feature is enabled, "
"and the device itself is enabled. When the device is enabled then enabled "
"features will be programmed into the device hardware."

msgid "Parameter Value"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/coresight/coresight-config.rst:55
msgid ""
"A parameter value is a named value that may be set by the user prior to the "
"feature being enabled that can adjust the behaviour of the operation "
"programmed by the feature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/coresight/coresight-config.rst:59
msgid ""
"For example, this could be a count value in a programmed operation that "
"repeats at a given rate. When the feature is enabled then the current value "
"of the parameter is used in programming the device."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/coresight/coresight-config.rst:63
msgid ""
"The feature descriptor defines a default value for a parameter, which is "
"used if the user does not supply a new value."

"Users can update parameter values using the configfs API for the CoreSight "

"As with the feature, a descriptor is used to define the configuration. This "

msgid "Preset Values"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/coresight/coresight-config.rst:94
msgid ""
"Preset values are easily selectable sets of parameter values for the "
"features that the configuration uses. The number of values in a single "
"preset set, equals the sum of parameter values in the features used by the "
"configuration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/coresight/coresight-config.rst:98
msgid ""
"e.g. a configuration consists of 3 features, one has 2 parameters, one has a "
"single parameter, and another has no parameters. A single preset set will "
"therefore have 3 values."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../trace/coresight/coresight-config.rst:102
