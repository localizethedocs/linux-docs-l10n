"These devices can be either stand-alone ASICs or IP blocks inside an SoC/"
"GPU. Although these devices are typically designed to accelerate Machine-"
"Learning (ML) and/or Deep-Learning (DL) computations, the accel layer is not "
"limited to handling these types of accelerators."

"Typically, a compute accelerator will belong to one of the following "

"Edge AI - doing inference at an edge device. It can be an embedded ASIC/"
"FPGA, or an IP inside a SoC (e.g. laptop web camera). These devices are "
"typically configured using registers and can work with or without DMA."

"Inference data-center - single/multi user devices in a large server. This "
"type of device can be stand-alone or an IP inside a SoC or a GPU. It will "
"have on-board DRAM (to hold the DL topology), DMA engines and command "
"submission queues (either kernel or user-space queues). It might also have "
"an MMU to manage multiple users and might also enable virtualization (SR-"
"IOV) to support multiple VMs on the same device. In addition, these devices "
"will usually have some tools, such as profiler and debugger."

"Training data-center - Similar to Inference data-center cards, but typically "
"have more computational power and memory b/w (e.g. HBM) and will likely have "
"a method of scaling-up/out, i.e. connecting to other training cards inside "
"the server or in other servers, respectively."

"All these devices typically have different runtime user-space software "
"stacks, that are tailored-made to their h/w. In addition, they will also "
"probably include a compiler to generate programs to their custom-made "
"computational engines. Typically, the common layer in user-space will be the "
"DL frameworks, such as PyTorch and TensorFlow."

"Because this type of devices can be an IP inside GPUs or have similar "
"characteristics as those of GPUs, the accel subsystem will use the DRM "
"subsystem's code and functionality. i.e. the accel core code will be part of "
"the DRM subsystem and an accel device will be a new type of DRM device."

"This will allow us to leverage the extensive DRM code-base and collaborate "

"of use to GPU drivers as well."

"Add the DRIVER_COMPUTE_ACCEL feature flag in your drm_driver's "

"two drivers that are connected using the auxiliary bus framework."
