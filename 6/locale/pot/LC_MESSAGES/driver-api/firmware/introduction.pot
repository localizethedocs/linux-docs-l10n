"Which one you use vary depending on your requirements, the rule of thumb "
"however is you should strive to use the asynchronous APIs unless you also "
"are already using asynchronous initialization mechanisms which will not "
"stall or delay boot. Even if loading firmware does not take a lot of time "
"processing firmware might, and this can still delay boot or initialization, "
"as such mechanisms such as asynchronous probe can help supplement drivers."
