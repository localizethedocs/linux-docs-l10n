"The ``pldmfw`` library is intended to be used by device drivers for "
"implementing device flash update based on firmware files following the PLDM "
"firmware file format."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pldmfw/index.rst:25
msgid ""
"It is implemented using an ops table that allows device drivers to provide "
"the underlying device specific functionality."

#: ../../../driver-api/pldmfw/index.rst:28
msgid ""
"``pldmfw`` implements logic to parse the packed binary format of the PLDM "
"firmware file into data structures, and then uses the provided function "
"operations to determine if the firmware file is a match for the device. If "
"so, it sends the record and component data to the firmware using the device "
"specific implementations provided by device drivers. Once the device "
"firmware indicates that the update may be performed, the firmware data is "
"sent to the device for programming."

msgid "Parsing the PLDM file"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pldmfw/index.rst:39
msgid ""
"The PLDM file format uses packed binary data, with most multi-byte fields "
"stored in the Little Endian format. Several pieces of data are variable "
"length, including version strings and the number of records and components. "
"Due to this, it is not straight forward to index the record, record "
"descriptors, or components."

#: ../../../driver-api/pldmfw/index.rst:45
msgid ""
"To avoid proliferating access to the packed binary data, the ``pldmfw`` "
"library parses and extracts this data into simpler structures for ease of "
"access."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/pldmfw/index.rst:49
msgid ""
"In order to safely process the firmware file, care is taken to avoid "
"unaligned access of multi-byte fields, and to properly convert from Little "
"Endian to CPU host format. Additionally the records, descriptors, and "
"components are stored in linked lists."
