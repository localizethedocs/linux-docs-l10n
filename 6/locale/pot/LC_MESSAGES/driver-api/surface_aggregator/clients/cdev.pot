"The ``surface_aggregator_cdev`` module provides a misc-device for the SSAM "
"controller to allow for a (more or less) direct connection from user-space "
"to the SAM EC. It is intended to be used for development and debugging, and "
"therefore should not be used or relied upon in any other way. Note that this "
"module is not loaded automatically, but instead must be loaded manually."

"Before events are available to be read, however, the desired notifiers must "

"essence, callbacks, called when the EC sends an event. They are, in this "

"Notifiers themselves do not enable events on the EC. Thus, it may "

"device-file-instance), events are enabled globally, for the EC and all of "
"its clients (regardless of userspace or non-userspace). The "
"``SSAM_CDEV_EVENT_ENABLE`` and ``SSAM_CDEV_EVENT_DISABLE`` IOCTLs take care "

"Note that enabled events are not automatically disabled once the client "

"calls. It is, however, perfectly valid to enable and disable events on "
"different client instances. For example, it is valid to set up notifiers and "
"read events on client instance ``A``, enable those events on instance ``B`` "
"(note that these will also be received by A since events are enabled/"
"disabled globally), and after no more events are desired, disable the "
"previously enabled events via instance ``C``."
