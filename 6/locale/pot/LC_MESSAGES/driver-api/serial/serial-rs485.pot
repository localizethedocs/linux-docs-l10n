"EIA-485, also known as TIA/EIA-485 or RS-485, is a standard defining the "
"electrical characteristics of drivers and receivers for use in balanced "
"digital multipoint systems. This standard is widely used for communications "
"in industrial automation because it can be used effectively over long "
"distances and in electrically noisy environments."

"Some CPUs/UARTs (e.g., Atmel AT91 or 16C950 UART) contain a built-in half-"
"duplex mode capable of automatically controlling line direction by toggling "
"RTS or DTR signals. That can be used to control external half-duplex "
"hardware like an RS485 transceiver or any RS232-connected half-duplex "
"devices like some modems."

"For these microcontrollers, the Linux driver should be made capable of "

"Any driver for devices capable of working both as RS232 and RS485 should "
"implement the ``rs485_config`` callback and provide ``rs485_supported`` in "
"the ``struct uart_port``. The serial core calls ``rs485_config`` to do the "
"device specific part in response to TIOCSRS485 ioctl (see below). The "
"``rs485_config`` callback receives a pointer to a sanitizated struct "
"serial_rs485. The struct serial_rs485 userspace provides is sanitized before "
"calling ``rs485_config`` using ``rs485_supported`` that indicates what RS485 "
"features the driver supports for the ``struct uart_port``. TIOCGRS485 ioctl "
"can be used to read back the struct serial_rs485 matching to the current "
