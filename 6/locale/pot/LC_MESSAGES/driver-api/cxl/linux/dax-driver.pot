"A `DAX Device` is a file-like interface exposed in :code:`/dev/daxN.Y`. A "
"memory region exposed via dax device can be accessed via userland software "

"The :code:`dax_kmem` driver converts a `DAX Device` into a series of "

"The :code:`memmap_on_memory` setting (both global and DAX device local) "
"dictates where the kernell will allocate the :code:`struct folio` "
"descriptors for this memory will come from.  If :code:`memmap_on_memory` is "
"set, memory hotplug will set aside a portion of the memory block capacity to "
"allocate folios. If unset, the memory is allocated via a normal :code:"
"`GFP_KERNEL` allocation - and as a result will most likely land on the local "
"NUM node of the CPU executing the hotplug operation."
