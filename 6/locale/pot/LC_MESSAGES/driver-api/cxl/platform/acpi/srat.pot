msgid ""
"The System/Static Resource Affinity Table describes resource (CPU, Memory) "
"affinity to \"Proximity Domains\". This table is technically optional, but "
"for performance information (see \"HMAT\") to be enumerated by linux it must "
"be present."

"There is a careful dance between the CEDT and SRAT tables and how NUMA nodes "
"are created.  If things don't look quite the way you expect - check the SRAT "
"Memory Affinity entries and CEDT CFMWS to determine what your platform "
"actually supports in terms of flexible topologies."

"The SRAT may statically assign portions of a CFMWS SPA range to a specific "
"proximity domains.  See linux numa creation for more information about how "
"this presents in the NUMA topology."

"A proximity domain is ROUGHLY equivalent to \"NUMA Node\" - though a 1-to-1 "
"mapping is not guaranteed.  There are scenarios where \"Proximity Domain 4\" "
"may map to \"NUMA Node 3\", for example.  (See \"NUMA Node Creation\")"

"Generally speaking, if a host does any amount of CXL fabric (decoder) "

msgid ""
"The Generic Port Affinity subtable provides an association between a "
"proximity domain and a device handle representing a Generic Port such as a "
"CXL host bridge. With the association, latency and bandwidth numbers can be "
"retrieved from the SRAT for the path between CPU(s) (initiator) and the "
"Generic Port. This is used to construct performance coordinates for "
"hotplugged CXL DEVICES, which cannot be enumerated at boot by platform "
"firmware."

msgid ""
"The Proximity Domain is matched up to the :doc:`HMAT <hmat>` SSLBI Target "
"Proximity Domain List for the related latency or bandwidth numbers. Those "
"performance numbers are tied to a CXL host bridge via the Device Handle. The "
"driver uses the association to retrieve the Generic Port performance numbers "
"for the whole CXL path access coordinates calculation."
