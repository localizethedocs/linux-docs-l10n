"The FPGA subsystem separates upper layers (userspace interfaces and "
"enumeration) from lower layers that know how to program a specific FPGA."

#: ../../../driver-api/fpga/intro.rst:13
msgid ""
"Code should not be shared between upper and lower layers.  This should go "
"without saying.  If that seems necessary, there's probably framework "
"functionality that can be added that will benefit other users.  Write the "
"linux-fpga mailing list and maintainers and seek out a solution that expands "
"the framework for broad reuse."

"If you are adding a new FPGA or a new method of programming an FPGA, this is "
"the subsystem for you.  Low level FPGA manager drivers contain the knowledge "

"FPGA Bridges prevent spurious signals from going out of an FPGA or a region "
"of an FPGA during programming.  They are disabled before programming begins "
"and re-enabled afterwards.  An FPGA bridge may be actual hard hardware that "
"gates a bus to a CPU or a soft (\"freeze\") bridge in FPGA fabric that "
"surrounds a partial reconfiguration region of an FPGA.  This subsystem "
"includes fpga-bridge.c and the low level drivers that are registered with it."

"The FPGA Region framework (fpga-region.c) associates managers and bridges as "
