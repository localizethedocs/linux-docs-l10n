msgid ""
"The ISL29003 is an integrated light sensor with a 16-bit integrating type "
"ADC, I2C user programmable lux range select for optimized counts/lux, and "
"I2C multi-function control and monitoring capabilities. The internal ADC "
"provides 16-bit resolution while rejecting 50Hz and 60Hz flicker caused by "
"artificial light sources."

"The driver allows to set the lux range, the bit resolution, the operational "
"mode (see below) and the power state of device and can read the current lux "
"value, of course."

"The ISL29003 does not have an ID register which could be used to identify "
"it, so the detection routine will just try to read from the configured I2C "
"address and consider the device to be present as soon as it ACKs the "
"transfer."
