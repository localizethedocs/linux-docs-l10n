"This driver provides support for the accelerometer found in various HP "
"laptops sporting the feature officially called \"HP Mobile Data Protection "
"System 3D\" or \"HP 3D DriveGuard\". It detects automatically laptops with "
"this sensor. Known models (full list can be found in drivers/platform/x86/"
"hp_accel.c) will have their axis automatically oriented on standard way (eg: "
"you can directly play neverball). The accelerometer data is readable via /"
"sys/devices/faux/lis3lv02d. Reported values are scaled to mg values "
"(1/1000th of earth gravity)."

"This driver also provides an absolute input class device, allowing the "
"laptop to act as a pinball machine-esque joystick. Joystick device can be "
"calibrated. Joystick device can be in two different modes. By default output "
"values are scaled between -32768 .. 32767. In joystick raw mode, joystick "
"and sysfs position entry have the same scale. There can be small difference "
"due to input system fuzziness feature. Events are also available as input "
"event device."

"Selftest is meant only for hardware diagnostic purposes. It is not meant to "
"be used during normal operations. Position data is not corrupted during "
"selftest but interrupt behaviour is not guaranteed to work reliably. In test "
"mode, the sensing element is internally moved little bit. Selftest measures "
"difference between normal mode and test mode. Chip specifications tell the "
"acceptance limit for each type of the chip. Limits are provided via platform "
"data to allow adjustment of the limits without a change to the actual "
"driver. Seltest returns either \"OK x y z\" or \"FAIL x y z\" where x, y and "
"z are measured difference between modes. Axes are not remapped in selftest "
"mode. Measurement values are provided to help HW diagnostic applications to "
"make final decision."

"Another feature of the driver is misc device called \"freefall\" that acts "
"similar to /dev/rtc and reacts on free-fall interrupts received from the "
"device. It supports blocking operations, poll/select and fasync operation "
"modes. You must read 1 bytes from the device.  The result is number of free-"
"fall interrupts since the last successful read (or 255 if number of "
"interrupts would not fit). See the freefall.c file for an example on using "
"the device."
