"The Multifunction Composite Gadget (or g_multi) is a composite gadget that "
"makes extensive use of the composite framework to provide a... multifunction "
"gadget."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usb/gadget_multi.rst:12
msgid ""
"In its standard configuration it provides a single USB configuration with "
"RNDIS[1] (that is Ethernet), USB CDC[2] ACM (that is serial) and USB Mass "
"Storage functions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usb/gadget_multi.rst:16
msgid ""
"A CDC ECM (Ethernet) function may be turned on via a Kconfig option and "
"RNDIS can be turned off.  If they are both enabled the gadget will have two "
"configurations -- one with RNDIS and another with CDC ECM[3]."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usb/gadget_multi.rst:20

"Please note that if you use non-standard configuration (that is enable CDC "
"ECM) you may need to change vendor and/or product ID."

"To make use of the gadget one needs to make it work on host side -- without "

msgid "Linux host drivers"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usb/gadget_multi.rst:33
msgid ""
"Since the gadget uses standard composite framework and appears as such to "
"Linux host it does not need any additional drivers on Linux host side.  All "
"the functions are handled by respective drivers developed for them."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usb/gadget_multi.rst:38
msgid ""
"This is also true for two configuration set-up with RNDIS configuration "
"being the first one.  Linux host will use the second configuration with CDC "
"ECM which should work better under Linux."

msgid ""
"First of all, Windows need to detect the gadget as an USB composite gadget "
"which on its own have some conditions[4].  If they are met, Windows lets USB "
"Generic Parent Driver[5] handle the device which then tries to match drivers "
"for each individual interface (sort of, don't get into too many details)."

msgid ""
"The good news is: you do not have to worry about most of the conditions!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usb/gadget_multi.rst:59
msgid ""
"The only thing to worry is that the gadget has to have a single "
"configuration so a dual RNDIS and CDC ECM gadget won't work unless you "
"create a proper INF -- and of course, if you do submit it!"

msgid ""
"To make Windows select RNDIS drivers for the first function in the gadget, "
"one needs to use the [[file:linux.inf]] file provided with this document.  "
"It \"attaches\" Window's RNDIS driver to the first interface of the gadget."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usb/gadget_multi.rst:82
msgid ""
"Please note, that while testing we encountered some issues[6] when RNDIS was "

msgid ""
"If you intend to hack the g_multi gadget be advised that rearranging "
"functions will obviously change interface numbers for each of the "
"functionality.  As an effect provided INFs won't work since they have "
"interface numbers hard-coded in them (it's not hard to change those "
"though[7])."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../usb/gadget_multi.rst:101
msgid ""
"This also means, that after experimenting with g_multi and changing provided "
"functions one should change gadget's vendor and/or product ID so there will "
"be no collision with other customised gadgets or the original gadget."

msgid ""
"Failing to comply may cause brain damage after wondering for hours why "
