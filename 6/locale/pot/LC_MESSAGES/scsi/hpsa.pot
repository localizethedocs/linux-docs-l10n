"This file describes the hpsa SCSI driver for HP Smart Array controllers. The "
"hpsa driver is intended to supplant the cciss driver for newer Smart Array "
"controllers.  The hpsa driver is a SCSI driver, while the cciss driver is a "
"\"block\" driver.  Actually cciss is both a block driver (for logical "
"drives) AND a SCSI driver (for tape drives). This \"split-brained\" design "
"of the cciss driver is a source of excess complexity and eliminating that "
"complexity is one of the reasons for hpsa to exist."

"Additionally, older Smart Arrays may work with the hpsa driver if the kernel "
"boot parameter \"hpsa_allow_any=1\" is specified, however these are not "
"tested nor supported by HP with this driver.  For older Smart Arrays, the "
"cciss driver should still be used."

"The \"hpsa_simple_mode=1\" boot parameter may be used to prevent the driver "
"from putting the controller into \"performant\" mode.  The difference is "
"that with simple mode, each command completion requires an interrupt, while "
"with \"performant mode\" (the default, and ordinarily better performing) it "
"is possible to have multiple command completions indicated by a single "
"interrupt."

"the host \"rescan\" attribute is a write only attribute.  Writing to this "

"(e.g. hot-plugged tape drives, or newly configured or deleted logical "
"drives, etc.) and notify the SCSI midlayer of any changes detected.  "
"Normally this is triggered automatically by HP's Array Configuration Utility "
"(either the GUI or command line variety) so for logical drive changes, the "

"plugging devices like tape drives, or entire storage boxes containing pre-"

"The \"resettable\" read-only attribute indicates whether a particular "

"This parameter is used by kdump, for example, to reset the controller at "
"driver load time to eliminate any outstanding commands on the controller and "
"get the controller into a known state so that the kdump initiated i/o will "
"work right and not be disrupted in any way by stale commands or other stale "
"state remaining on the controller from the previous kernel.  This attribute "
"enables kexec tools to warn the user if they attempt to designate a device "
"which is unable to honor the reset_devices kernel parameter as a dump device."
