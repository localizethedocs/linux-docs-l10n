"This driver supports the Qlogic FASXXX family of chips.  This driver only "
"works with the ISA, VLB, and PCMCIA versions of the Qlogic FastSCSI!  cards "

"Concepts SCSI/IDE/SIO/PIO/FDC cards)."

"This currently only works if the card is enabled first from DOS.  This means "
"you will have to load your socket and card services, and QL41DOS.SYS and "
"QL40ENBL.SYS.  These are a minimum, but loading the rest of the modules "
"won't interfere with the operation.  The next thing to do is load the kernel "
"without resetting the hardware, which can be a simple ctrl-alt-delete with a "
"boot floppy, or by using loadlin with the kernel image accessible from DOS.  "
"If you are using the Linux PCMCIA driver, you will have to adjust it or "
"otherwise stop it from configuring the card."

"The top of the qlogic.c file has a number of defines that controls "
"configuration.  As shipped, it provides a balance between speed and "
"function.  If there are any problems, try setting SLOW_CABLE to 1, and then "
"try changing USE_IRQ and TURBO_PDMA to zero.  If you are familiar with SCSI, "
"there are other settings which can tune the bus."

"It may be a good idea to enable RESET_AT_START, especially if the devices "
"may not have been just powered up, or if you are restarting after a crash, "
"since they may be busy trying to complete the last command or something.  It "
"comes up faster if this is set to zero, and if you have reliable hardware "
"and connections it may be more useful to not reset things."

"The best way to test if your cables, termination, etc. are good is to copy a "
"very big file (e.g. a doublespace container file, or a very large executable "
"or archive).  It should be at least 5 megabytes, but you can do multiple "
"tests on smaller files.  Then do a COMP to verify that the file copied "
"properly.  (Turn off all caching when doing these tests, otherwise you will "
"test your RAM and not the files).  Then do 10 COMPs, comparing the same file "
"on the SCSI hard drive, i.e. \"COMP realbig.doc realbig.doc\".  Then do it "
"after the computer gets warm."

"I noticed my system which seems to work 100% would fail this test if the "
"computer was left on for a few hours.  It was worse with longer cables, and "
"more devices on the SCSI bus.  What seems to happen is that it gets a false "
"ACK causing an extra byte to be inserted into the stream (and this is not "
"detected).  This can be caused by bad termination (the ACK can be "
"reflected), or by noise when the chips work less well because of the heat, "
"or when cables get too long for the speed."
