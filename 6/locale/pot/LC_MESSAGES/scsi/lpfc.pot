"Starting in the 8.0.17 release, the driver began to be targeted strictly "
"toward the upstream kernel. As such, we removed #ifdefs for older kernels "
"(pre 2.6.10). The 8.0.16 release should be used if the driver is to be run "
"on one of the older kernels."

"The proposed modifications to the transport layer for FC remote ports and "
"extended attribute support is now part of the upstream kernel as of 2.6.12. "
"We no longer need to provide patches for this support, nor a *full* version "
"which has old an new kernel support."

msgid ""
"In older revisions of the lpfc driver, the driver internally queued i/o "
"received from the midlayer. In the cases where a cable was pulled, link "
"jitter, or a device temporarily loses connectivity (due to its cable being "
"removed, a switch rebooting, or a device reboot), the driver could hide the "
"disappearance of the device from the midlayer. I/O's issued to the LLDD "
"would simply be queued for a short duration, allowing the device to reappear "
"or link come back alive, with no inadvertent side effects to the system. If "
"the driver did not hide these conditions, i/o would be errored by the "
"driver, the mid-layer would exhaust its retries, and the device would be "
"taken offline. Manual intervention would be required to re-enable the device."

"The community supporting kernel.org has driven an effort to remove internal "
"queuing from all LLDDs. The philosophy is that internal queuing is "
"unnecessary as the block layer already performs the queuing. Removing the "
"queues from the LLDD makes a more predictable and more simple LLDD."

"As a potential new addition to kernel.org, the 8.x driver was asked to have "
"all internal queuing removed. Emulex complied with this request. In "
"explaining the impacts of this change, Emulex has worked with the community "
"in modifying the behavior of the SCSI midlayer so that SCSI devices can be "
"temporarily suspended while transport events (such as those described) can "
"occur."

"The proposed patch was posted to the linux-scsi mailing list. The patch is "
