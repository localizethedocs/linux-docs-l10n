"The DNS resolver module provides a way for kernel services to make DNS "
"queries by way of requesting a key of key type dns_resolver.  These queries "
"are upcalled to userspace through /sbin/request-key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:24
msgid ""
"These routines must be supported by userspace tools dns.upcall, cifs.upcall "
"and request-key.  It is under development and does not yet provide the full "
"feature set.  The features it does support include:"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:48
msgid ""
"To set up this facility, the /etc/request-key.conf file must be altered so "
"that /sbin/request-key can appropriately direct the upcalls.  For example, "
"to handle basic dname to IPv4/IPv6 address resolution, the following line "
"should be added::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To direct a query for query type 'foo', a line of the following should be "
"added before the more general line given above as the first match is the one "

msgid "Usage"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:67
msgid ""
"To make use of this facility, first ``dns_resolver.h`` must be included::"

msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:76
msgid ""
"This is the basic access function.  It looks for a cached DNS query and if "
"it doesn't find it, it upcalls to userspace to make a new DNS query, which "
"may then be cached.  The key description is constructed as a string of the "
"form::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:83
msgid ""
"where <type> optionally specifies the particular upcall program to invoke, "
"and thus the type of query, and <name> specifies the string to be looked up. "
"The default query type is a straight hostname to IP address set lookup."

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:87
msgid ""
"The name parameter is not required to be a NUL-terminated string, and its "

"The return value is a string appropriate to the query type.  For instance, "
"for the default query type it is just a list of comma-separated IPv4 and "
"IPv6 addresses.  The caller must free the result."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:97
msgid ""
"The length of the result string is returned on success, and a negative error "

"The dns_resolver module registers a key type called \"dns_resolver\".  Keys "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:122
msgid ""
"When dns_query() is invoked, it calls request_key() to search the local "

"userspace to get a new result."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:126
msgid ""
"Upcalls to userspace are made through the request_key() upcall vector, and "
"are directed by means of configuration lines in /etc/request-key.conf that "
"tell /sbin/request-key what program to run to instantiate the key."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:130
msgid ""
"The upcall handler program is responsible for querying the DNS, processing "
"the result into a form suitable for passing to the keyctl_instantiate_key() "
"routine.  This then passes the data to dns_resolver_instantiate() which "
"strips off and processes any options included in the data, and then attaches "
"the remainder of the string to the key as its payload."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/dns_resolver.rst:136
msgid ""
"The upcall handler program should set the expiry time on the key to that of "
"the lowest TTL of all the records it has extracted a result from.  This "

"has expired."
