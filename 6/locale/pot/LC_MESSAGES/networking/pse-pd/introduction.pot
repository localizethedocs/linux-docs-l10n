"Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) is essential in networks for delivering power "
"along with data over Ethernet cables. It usually refers to devices like "
"switches and hubs that supply power to Powered Devices (PDs) such as IP "
"cameras, VoIP phones, and wireless access points."

"PSE in the IEEE 802.3 standard generally refers to equipment that provides "
"power alongside data over Ethernet cables, typically associated with Power "

"PoDL PSE, or Power over Data Lines PSE, specifically denotes PSEs operating "
"with single balanced twisted-pair PHYs, as per Clause 104 of IEEE 802.3. "
"PoDL is significant in contexts like automotive and industrial controls "
"where power and data delivery over a single pair is advantageous."

"For general PSE (PoE) code, use \"c33_pse\" key words. For example: ``enum "

"For PoDL PSE - specific code, use \"podl_pse\". For example: ``enum "
