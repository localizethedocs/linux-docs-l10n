"The IEEE 802.1Q-2022 (Bridges and Bridged Networks) standard defines the "
"operation of bridges in computer networks. A bridge, in the context of this "
"standard, is a device that connects two or more network segments and "
"operates at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI (Open Systems "
"Interconnection) model. The purpose of a bridge is to filter and forward "
"frames between different segments based on the destination MAC (Media Access "
"Control) address."
