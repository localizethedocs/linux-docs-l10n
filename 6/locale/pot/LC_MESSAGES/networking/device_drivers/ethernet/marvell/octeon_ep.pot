"Network Interface control like changing mtu, link speed, link down/up are "
"done by writing command to mailbox command queue, a mailbox interface "
"implemented through a reserved region in BAR4. This driver writes the "
"commands into the mailbox and the firmware on the Octeon device processes "
"them. The firmware also sends unsolicited notifications to driver for events "
"suchs as link change, through notification queue implemented as part of "
"mailbox interface."
