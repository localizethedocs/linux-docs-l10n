"First of all, you can get ARCnet cards in at least two speeds: 2.5 Mbps "
"(slower than Ethernet) and 100 Mbps (faster than normal Ethernet).  In fact, "
"there are others as well, but these are less common.  The different hardware "
"types, as far as I'm aware, are not compatible and so you cannot wire a 100 "
"Mbps card to a 2.5 Mbps card, and so on.  From what I hear, my driver does "
"work with 100 Mbps cards, but I haven't been able to verify this myself, "
"since I only have the 2.5 Mbps variety.  It is probably not going to "
"saturate your 100 Mbps card.  Stop complaining. :)"

"There are two \"types\" of ARCnet - STAR topology and BUS topology.  This "
"refers to how the cards are meant to be wired together.  According to most "
"available documentation, you can only connect STAR cards to STAR cards and "
"BUS cards to BUS cards.  That makes sense, right?  Well, it's not quite "
"true; see below under \"Cabling.\""
msgstr ""

"Once you get past these little stumbling blocks, ARCnet is actually quite a "
"well-designed standard.  It uses something called \"modified token passing\" "
"which makes it completely incompatible with so-called \"Token Ring\" cards, "
"but which makes transfers much more reliable than Ethernet does.  In fact, "
"ARCnet will guarantee that a packet arrives safely at the destination, and "
"even if it can't possibly be delivered properly (ie. because of a cable "
"break, or because the destination computer does not exist) it will at least "
"tell the sender about it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/arcnet-hardware.rst:54

"Because of the carefully defined action of the \"token\", it will always "
"make a pass around the \"ring\" within a maximum length of time.  This makes "
"it useful for realtime networks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/arcnet-hardware.rst:58
msgid ""
"In addition, all known ARCnet cards have an (almost) identical programming "
"interface.  This means that with one ARCnet driver you can support any card, "
"whereas with Ethernet each manufacturer uses what is sometimes a completely "
"different programming interface, leading to a lot of different, sometimes "
"very similar, Ethernet drivers.  Of course, always using the same "
"programming interface also means that when high-performance hardware "
"facilities like PCI bus mastering DMA appear, it's hard to take advantage of "
"them.  Let's not go into that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/arcnet-hardware.rst:67

"One thing that makes ARCnet cards difficult to program for, however, is the "
"limit on their packet sizes; standard ARCnet can only send packets that are "
"up to 508 bytes in length.  This is smaller than the Internet \"bare "
"minimum\" of 576 bytes, let alone the Ethernet MTU of 1500.  To compensate, "
"an extra level of encapsulation is defined by RFC1201, which I call \"packet "
"splitting,\" that allows \"virtual packets\" to grow as large as 64K each, "
