"North Mux-Agent is a function of the Intel PMC firmware that is supported on "
"most Intel based platforms that have the PMC microcontroller. It's used for "
"configuring the various USB Multiplexer/DeMultiplexers on the system. The "
"platforms that allow the mux-agent to be configured from the operating "
"system have an ACPI device object (node) with HID \"INTC105C\" that "
"represents it."

"The North Mux-Agent (aka. Intel PMC Mux Control, or just mux-agent) driver "
"communicates with the PMC microcontroller by using the PMC IPC method "
"(drivers/platform/x86/intel_scu_ipc.c). The driver registers with the USB "
"Type-C Mux Class which allows the USB Type-C Controller and Interface "
"drivers to configure the cable plug orientation and mode (with Alternate "
"Modes). The driver also registers with the USB Role Class in order to "
"support both USB Host and Device modes. The driver is located here: drivers/"

"In order to configure the muxes behind a USB Type-C connector, the PMC "
"firmware needs to know the USB2 port and the USB3 port that is associated "
"with the connector. The driver extracts the correct port numbers by reading "
"specific _DSD device properties named \"usb2-port-number\" and \"usb3-port-"
"number\". These properties have integer value that means the port index. The "
"port index number is 1's based, and value 0 is illegal. The driver uses the "
"numbers extracted from these device properties as-is when sending the mux-"
"agent specific messages to the PMC::"

"Depending on the platform, the data and SBU lines coming from the connector "

"agent driver should not configure them according to the cable plug "
"orientation. This can happen for example if a retimer on the platform "
"handles the cable plug orientation. The driver uses a specific device "
"properties \"sbu-orientation\" (SBU) and \"hsl-orientation\" (data) to know "
"if those lines are \"fixed\", and to which orientation. The value that these "
"properties have is a string value, and it can be one that is defined for the "
