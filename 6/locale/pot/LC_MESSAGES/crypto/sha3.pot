"The SHA-3 family of algorithms, as specified in NIST FIPS-202 [1]_, contains "
"six algorithms based on the Keccak sponge function.  The differences between "
"them are: the \"rate\" (how much of the state buffer gets updated with new "
"data between invocations of the Keccak function and analogous to the \"block "
"size\"), what domain separation suffix gets appended to the input data, and "
"how much output data is extracted at the end.  The Keccak sponge function is "
