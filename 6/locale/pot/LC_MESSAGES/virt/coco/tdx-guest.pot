"A subtype index is added at the end of this IOCTL CMD to uniquely identify "
"the subtype-specific TDREPORT request. Although the subtype option is "
"mentioned in the TDX Module v1.0 specification, section titled \"TDG.MR."
"REPORT\", it is not currently used, and it expects this value to be 0. So to "
"keep the IOCTL implementation simple, the subtype option was not included as "
"part of the input ABI. However, in the future, if the TDX Module supports "
"more than one subtype, a new IOCTL CMD will be created to handle it. To keep "
"the IOCTL naming consistent, a subtype index is added as part of the IOCTL "
"CMD."
