"Dma-buf Heaps are a way for userspace to allocate dma-buf objects. They are "

"The ``default_cma_region`` heap allocates physically contiguous, cacheable, "

"created either through the kernel commandline through the ``cma`` parameter, "
"a memory region Device-Tree node with the ``linux,cma-default`` property "
"set, or through the ``CMA_SIZE_MBYTES`` or ``CMA_SIZE_PERCENTAGE`` Kconfig "
"options. Prior to Linux 6.17, its name wasn't stable and could be called "
"``reserved``, ``linux,cma``, or ``default-pool``, depending on the platform."

"The name must describe the memory region the heap will allocate from, and "
