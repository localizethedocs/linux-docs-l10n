"Video inputs and outputs are physical connectors of a device. These can be "
"for example: RF connectors (antenna/cable), CVBS a.k.a. Composite Video, S-"
"Video and RGB connectors. Camera sensors are also considered to be a video "
"input. Video and VBI capture devices have inputs. Video and VBI output "
"devices have outputs, at least one each. Radio devices have no video inputs "
"or outputs."

"To learn about the number and attributes of the available inputs and outputs "
"applications can enumerate them with the :ref:`VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT` and :ref:"
"`VIDIOC_ENUMOUTPUT` ioctl, respectively. The struct :c:type:`v4l2_input` "
"returned by the :ref:`VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT` ioctl also contains signal status "

"The :ref:`VIDIOC_G_INPUT <VIDIOC_G_INPUT>` and :ref:`VIDIOC_G_OUTPUT "
"<VIDIOC_G_OUTPUT>` ioctls return the index of the current video input or "
"output. To select a different input or output applications call the :ref:"
"`VIDIOC_S_INPUT <VIDIOC_G_INPUT>` and :ref:`VIDIOC_S_OUTPUT "
"<VIDIOC_G_OUTPUT>` ioctls. Drivers must implement all the input ioctls when "
"the device has one or more inputs, all the output ioctls when the device has "
"one or more outputs."
