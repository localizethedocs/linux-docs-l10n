"Radio devices may have a couple audio controls (as discussed in :ref:"
"`control`) such as a volume control, possibly custom controls. Further all "
"radio devices have one tuner or modulator (these are discussed in :ref:"
"`tuner`) with index number zero to select the radio frequency and to "
"determine if a monaural or FM stereo program is received/emitted. Drivers "
"switch automatically between AM and FM depending on the selected frequency. "
"The :ref:`VIDIOC_G_TUNER <VIDIOC_G_TUNER>` or :ref:`VIDIOC_G_MODULATOR "
"<VIDIOC_G_MODULATOR>` ioctl reports the supported frequency range."
