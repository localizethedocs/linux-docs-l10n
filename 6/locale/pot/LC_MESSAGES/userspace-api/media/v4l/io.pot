"The V4L2 API defines several different methods to read from or write to a "
"device. All drivers exchanging data with applications must support at least "
"one of them."

msgid ""
"The classic I/O method using the :c:func:`read()` and :c:func:`write()` "
"function is automatically selected after opening a V4L2 device. When the "
"driver does not support this method attempts to read or write will fail at "
"any time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/media/v4l/io.rst:18
msgid ""
"Other methods must be negotiated. To select the streaming I/O method with "
"memory mapped or user buffers applications call the :ref:`VIDIOC_REQBUFS` "
"ioctl."

msgid ""
"Video overlay can be considered another I/O method, although the application "
"does not directly receive the image data. It is selected by initiating video "
"overlay with the :ref:`VIDIOC_S_FMT <VIDIOC_G_FMT>` ioctl. For more "
"information see :ref:`overlay`."

#: ../../../userspace-api/media/v4l/io.rst:27
msgid ""
"Generally exactly one I/O method, including overlay, is associated with each "
"file descriptor. The only exceptions are applications not exchanging data "
"with a driver (\"panel applications\", see :ref:`open`) and drivers "
"permitting simultaneous video capturing and overlay using the same file "
"descriptor, for compatibility with V4L and earlier versions of V4L2."

":ref:`VIDIOC_S_FMT <VIDIOC_G_FMT>` and :ref:`VIDIOC_REQBUFS` would permit "
"this to some degree, but for simplicity drivers need not support switching "
"the I/O method (after first switching away from read/write) other than by "
"closing and reopening the device."
