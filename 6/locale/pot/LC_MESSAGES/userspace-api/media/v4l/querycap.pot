"Because V4L2 covers a wide variety of devices not all aspects of the API are "
"equally applicable to all types of devices. Furthermore devices of the same "
"type have different capabilities and this specification permits the omission "
"of a few complicated and less important parts of the API."

"The :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` ioctl is available to check if the kernel device "
"is compatible with this specification, and to query the :ref:`functions "
"<devices>` and :ref:`I/O methods <io>` supported by the device."

"Starting with kernel version 3.1, :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` will return the "
"V4L2 API version used by the driver, with generally matches the Kernel "
"version. There's no need of using :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` to check if a "
"specific ioctl is supported, the V4L2 core now returns ``ENOTTY`` if a "
"driver doesn't provide support for an ioctl."

"Other features can be queried by calling the respective ioctl, for example :"
"ref:`VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT` to learn about the number, types and names of video "
"connectors on the device. Although abstraction is a major objective of this "
"API, the :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` ioctl also allows driver specific "
"applications to reliably identify the driver."

"All V4L2 drivers must support :ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP`. Applications should "
"always call this ioctl after opening the device."
