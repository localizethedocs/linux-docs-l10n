"A buffer contains data exchanged by application and driver using one of the "
"Streaming I/O methods. In the multi-planar API, the data is held in planes, "
"while the buffer structure acts as a container for the planes. Only pointers "
"to buffers (planes) are exchanged, the data itself is not copied. These "
"pointers, together with meta-information like timestamps or field parity, "
"are stored in a struct :c:type:`v4l2_buffer`, argument to the :ref:"
"`VIDIOC_QUERYBUF`, :ref:`VIDIOC_QBUF <VIDIOC_QBUF>` and :ref:`VIDIOC_DQBUF "
"<VIDIOC_QBUF>` ioctl. In the multi-planar API, some plane-specific members "
"of struct :c:type:`v4l2_buffer`, such as pointers and sizes for each plane, "
"are stored in struct :c:type:`v4l2_plane` instead. In that case, struct :c:"
"type:`v4l2_buffer` contains an array of plane structures."

"Dequeued video buffers come with timestamps. The driver decides at which "
"part of the frame and with which clock the timestamp is taken. Please see "
"flags in the masks ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_MASK`` and "
"``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TSTAMP_SRC_MASK`` in :ref:`buffer-flags`. These flags are "
"always valid and constant across all buffers during the whole video stream. "
"Changes in these flags may take place as a side effect of :ref:"
"`VIDIOC_S_INPUT <VIDIOC_G_INPUT>` or :ref:`VIDIOC_S_OUTPUT "
"<VIDIOC_G_OUTPUT>` however. The ``V4L2_BUF_FLAG_TIMESTAMP_COPY`` timestamp "
"type which is used by e.g. on mem-to-mem devices is an exception to the "
"rule: the timestamp source flags are copied from the OUTPUT video buffer to "
"the CAPTURE video buffer."
