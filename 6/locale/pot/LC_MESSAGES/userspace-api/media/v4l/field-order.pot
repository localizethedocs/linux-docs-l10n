"We have to distinguish between progressive and interlaced video. Progressive "
"video transmits all lines of a video image sequentially. Interlaced video "
"divides an image into two fields, containing only the odd and even lines of "
"the image, respectively. Alternating the so called odd and even field are "
"transmitted, and due to a small delay between fields a cathode ray TV "
"displays the lines interleaved, yielding the original frame. This curious "
"technique was invented because at refresh rates similar to film the image "
"would fade out too quickly. Transmitting fields reduces the flicker without "
"the necessity of doubling the frame rate and with it the bandwidth required "
"for each channel."

"It is important to understand a video camera does not expose one frame at a "
"time, merely transmitting the frames separated into fields. The fields are "
"in fact captured at two different instances in time. An object on screen may "
"well move between one field and the next. For applications analysing motion "
"it is of paramount importance to recognize which field of a frame is older, "
"the *temporal order*."

"When the driver provides or accepts images field by field rather than "
"interleaved, it is also important applications understand how the fields "
"combine to frames. We distinguish between top (aka odd) and bottom (aka "
"even) fields, the *spatial order*: The first line of the top field is the "
"first line of an interlaced frame, the first line of the bottom field is the "
"second line of that frame."

"However because fields were captured one after the other, arguing whether a "
"frame commences with the top or bottom field is pointless. Any two "
"successive top and bottom, or bottom and top fields yield a valid frame. "
"Only when the source was progressive to begin with, e. g. when transferring "
"film to video, two fields may come from the same frame, creating a natural "
"order."

"Counter to intuition the top field is not necessarily the older field. "
"Whether the older field contains the top or bottom lines is a convention "
"determined by the video standard. Hence the distinction between temporal and "
"spatial order of fields. The diagrams below should make this clearer."

"In V4L it is assumed that all video cameras transmit fields on the media bus "
"in the same order they were captured, so if the top field was captured first "
"(is the older field), the top field is also transmitted first on the bus."
