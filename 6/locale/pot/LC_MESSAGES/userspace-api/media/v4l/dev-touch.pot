"Processing is required to analyse the raw data and produce input events. In "
"some systems, this may be performed on the ASIC and the raw data is purely a "
"side-channel for diagnostics or tuning. In other systems, the ASIC is a "
"simple analogue front end device which delivers touch data at high rate, and "
"any touch processing must be done on the host."

"For capacitive touch sensing, the touchscreen is composed of an array of "
"horizontal and vertical conductors (alternatively called rows/columns, X/Y "
"lines, or tx/rx). Mutual Capacitance measured is at the nodes where the "
"conductors cross. Alternatively, Self Capacitance measures the signal from "
"each column and row independently."
