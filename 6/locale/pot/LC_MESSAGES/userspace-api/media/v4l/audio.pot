"Audio inputs and outputs are physical connectors of a device. Video capture "
"devices have inputs, output devices have outputs, zero or more each. Radio "
"devices have no audio inputs or outputs. They have exactly one tuner which "
"in fact *is* an audio source, but this API associates tuners with video "
"inputs or outputs only, and radio devices have none of these. [#f1]_ A "
"connector on a TV card to loop back the received audio signal to a sound "
"card is not considered an audio output."

"Audio and video inputs and outputs are associated. Selecting a video source "
"also selects an audio source. This is most evident when the video and audio "
"source is a tuner. Further audio connectors can combine with more than one "
"video input or output. Assumed two composite video inputs and two audio "
"inputs exist, there may be up to four valid combinations. The relation of "
"video and audio connectors is defined in the ``audioset`` field of the "
"respective struct :c:type:`v4l2_input` or struct :c:type:`v4l2_output`, "
"where each bit represents the index number, starting at zero, of one audio "
"input or output."

"type:`v4l2_audio` returned by the :ref:`VIDIOC_ENUMAUDIO` ioctl also "
