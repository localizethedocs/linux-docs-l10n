"Video devices typically support one or more different video standards or "
"variations of standards. Each video input and output may support another set "
"of standards. This set is reported by the ``std`` field of struct :c:type:"
"`v4l2_input` and struct :c:type:`v4l2_output` returned by the :ref:"
"`VIDIOC_ENUMINPUT` and :ref:`VIDIOC_ENUMOUTPUT` ioctls, respectively."

"V4L2 defines one bit for each analog video standard currently in use "
"worldwide, and sets aside bits for driver defined standards, e. g. hybrid "
"standards to watch NTSC video tapes on PAL TVs and vice versa. Applications "
"can use the predefined bits to select a particular standard, although "
"presenting the user a menu of supported standards is preferred. To enumerate "
"and query the attributes of the supported standards applications use the :"
"ref:`VIDIOC_ENUMSTD` ioctl."

"Many of the defined standards are actually just variations of a few major "
"standards. The hardware may in fact not distinguish between them, or do so "
"internal and switch automatically. Therefore enumerated standards also "
"contain sets of one or more standard bits."

"Assume a hypothetic tuner capable of demodulating B/PAL, G/PAL and I/PAL "
"signals. The first enumerated standard is a set of B and G/PAL, switched "
"automatically depending on the selected radio frequency in UHF or VHF band. "
"Enumeration gives a \"PAL-B/G\" or \"PAL-I\" choice. Similar a Composite "
"input may collapse standards, enumerating \"PAL-B/G/H/I\", \"NTSC-M\" and "
"\"SECAM-D/K\". [#f1]_"
