"The Dell Systems Management Base Driver provides a sysfs interface for "
"systems management software such as Dell OpenManage to perform system "
"management interrupts and host control actions (system power cycle or power "
"off after OS shutdown) on certain Dell systems."

"On some Dell systems, systems management software must access certain "
"management information via a system management interrupt (SMI).  The SMI "
"data buffer must reside in 32-bit address space, and the physical address of "
"the buffer is required for the SMI.  The driver maintains the memory "
"required for the SMI and provides a way for the application to generate the "
"SMI. The driver creates the following sysfs entries for systems management "
"software to perform these system management interrupts::"
