"GFS2 is a cluster file system. It allows a cluster of computers to "
"simultaneously use a block device that is shared between them (with FC, "
"iSCSI, NBD, etc).  GFS2 reads and writes to the block device like a local "
"file system, but also uses a lock module to allow the computers coordinate "
"their I/O so file system consistency is maintained.  One of the nifty "
"features of GFS2 is perfect consistency -- changes made to the file system "
"on one machine show up immediately on all other machines in the cluster."
