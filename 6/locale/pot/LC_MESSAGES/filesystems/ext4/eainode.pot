"To enable ext4 to store extended attribute values that do not fit in the "
"inode or in the single extended attribute block attached to an inode, the "
"EA_INODE feature allows us to store the value in the data blocks of a "
"regular file inode. This “EA inode” is linked only from the extended "
"attribute name index and must not appear in a directory entry. The inode's "
"i_atime field is used to store a checksum of the xattr value; and i_ctime/"
"i_version store a 64-bit reference count, which enables sharing of large "
"xattr values between multiple owning inodes. For backward compatibility with "
"older versions of this feature, the i_mtime/i_generation *may* store a back-"
"reference to the inode number and i_generation of the **one** owning inode "
"(in cases where the EA inode is not referenced by multiple inodes) to verify "
"that the EA inode is the correct one being accessed."
