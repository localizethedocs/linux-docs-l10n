"ext4 supports fs-verity, which is a filesystem feature that provides Merkle "
"tree based hashing for individual readonly files.  Most of fs-verity is "
"common to all filesystems that support it; see :ref:`Documentation/"
"filesystems/fsverity.rst <fsverity>` for the fs-verity documentation.  "
"However, the on-disk layout of the verity metadata is filesystem-specific.  "
"On ext4, the verity metadata is stored after the end of the file data "
"itself, in the following format:"
