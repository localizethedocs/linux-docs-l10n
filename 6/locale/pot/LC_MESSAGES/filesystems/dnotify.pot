"The intention of directory notification is to allow user applications to be "
"notified when a directory, or any of the files in it, are changed. The basic "
"mechanism involves the application registering for notification on a "
"directory using a fcntl(2) call and the notifications themselves being "
"delivered using signals."

"By default, SIGIO will be delivered to the process and no other useful "
"information.  However, if the F_SETSIG fcntl(2) call is used to let the "
"kernel know which signal to deliver, a siginfo structure will be passed to "
"the signal handler and the si_fd member of that structure will contain the "
"file descriptor associated with the directory in which the event occurred."

"Preferably the application will choose one of the real time signals "
"(SIGRTMIN + <n>) so that the notifications may be queued.  This is "
"especially important if DN_MULTISHOT is specified.  Note that SIGRTMIN is "
"often blocked, so it is better to use (at least) SIGRTMIN + 1."

"The notification should work for any local access to files even if the "
"actual file system is on a remote server.  This implies that remote access "
"to files served by local user mode servers should be notified. Also, remote "
"accesses to files served by a local kernel NFS server should be notified."

"In order to make the impact on the file system code as small as possible, "
"the problem of hard links to files has been ignored.  So if a file (x) "
"exists in two directories (a and b) then a change to the file using the name "
"\"a/x\" should be notified to a program expecting notifications on directory "
"\"a\", but will not be notified to one expecting notifications on directory "
