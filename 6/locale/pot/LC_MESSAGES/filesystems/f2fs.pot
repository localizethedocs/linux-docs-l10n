"NAND flash memory-based storage devices, such as SSD, eMMC, and SD cards, "
"have been equipped on a variety systems ranging from mobile to server "
"systems. Since they are known to have different characteristics from the "
"conventional rotating disks, a file system, an upper layer to the storage "
"device, should adapt to the changes from the sketch in the design level."

"F2FS is a file system exploiting NAND flash memory-based storage devices, "

"\"A log-structured file system writes all modifications to disk sequentially "
"in a log-like structure, thereby speeding up  both file writing and crash "
"recovery. The log is the only structure on disk; it contains indexing "
"information so that files can be read back from the log efficiently. In "
"order to maintain large free areas on disk for fast writing, we divide  the "
"log into segments and use a segment cleaner to compress the live information "
"from heavily fragmented segments.\" from Rosenblum, M. and Ousterhout, J. "

"In LFS, when a file data is updated and written to the end of log, its "

"and checkpoint block are also updated recursively. This problem is called as "
"wandering tree problem [1], and in order to enhance the performance, it "
