"The ``BPF_MAP_TYPE_XSKMAP`` is used as a backend map for XDP BPF helper call "
"``bpf_redirect_map()`` and ``XDP_REDIRECT`` action, like 'devmap' and "
"'cpumap'. This map type redirects raw XDP frames to `AF_XDP`_ sockets "
"(XSKs), a new type of address family in the kernel that allows redirection "
"of frames from a driver to user space without having to traverse the full "
"network stack. An AF_XDP socket binds to a single netdev queue. A mapping of "
"XSKs to queues is shown below:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../bpf/map_xskmap.rst:43
msgid ""
"An AF_XDP socket that is bound to a certain <netdev/queue_id> will *only* "
"accept XDP frames from that <netdev/queue_id>. If an XDP program tries to "
"redirect from a <netdev/queue_id> other than what the socket is bound to, "
"the frame will not be received on the socket."

"Typically an XSKMAP is created per netdev. This map contains an array of XSK "
"File Descriptors (FDs). The number of array elements is typically set or "
"adjusted using the ``max_entries`` map parameter. For AF_XDP ``max_entries`` "
"is equal to the number of queues supported by the netdev."
