"Unfortunately, to effectively test the support for the system-wide suspend "
"and resume transitions in a driver, it is necessary to suspend and resume a "
"fully functional system with this driver loaded.  Moreover, that should be "
"done several times, preferably several times in a row, and separately for "
"hibernation (aka suspend to disk or STD) and suspend to RAM (STR), because "
"each of these cases involves slightly different operations and different "
"interactions with the machine's BIOS."

"Of course, for this purpose the test system has to be known to suspend and "
"resume without the driver being tested.  Thus, if possible, you should first "
"resolve all suspend/resume-related problems in the test system before you "
"start testing the new driver.  Please see Documentation/power/basic-pm-"
"debugging.rst for more information about the debugging of suspend/resume "
"functionality."
