"This document is a guide to using the emu10k1 based devices with JACK for "
"low latency, multichannel recording functionality.  All of my recent work to "
"allow Linux users to use the full capabilities of their hardware has been "
"inspired by the kX Project.  Without their work I never would have "
"discovered the true power of this hardware."

"Until recently, emu10k1 users on Linux did not have access to the same low "
"latency, multichannel features offered by the \"kX ASIO\" feature of their "

"For those unfamiliar with kX ASIO, this consists of 16 capture and 16 "

"(1.33 ms) or even 32 (0.66ms) frames should work well."

"The configuration is slightly more involved than on Windows, as you have to "
"select the correct device for JACK to use.  Actually, for qjackctl users "
"it's fairly self explanatory - select Duplex, then for capture and playback "
"select the multichannel devices, set the in and out channels to 16, and the "
"sample rate to 48000Hz.  The command line looks like this: ::"

"The 16 input ports are connected to the 16 physical inputs.  Contrary to "
"popular belief, all emu10k1 cards are multichannel cards.  Which of these "
"input channels have physical inputs connected to them depends on the card "
"model.  Trial and error is highly recommended; the pinout diagrams for the "
"card have been reverse engineered by some enterprising kX users and are "
"available on the internet.  Meterbridge is helpful here, and the kX forums "
