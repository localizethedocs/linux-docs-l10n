"The EMU10K2 chips have a very short capture FIFO, which makes recording "
"unreliable if the card's PCI bus requests are not handled with the "
"appropriate priority. This is the case on more modern motherboards, where "
"the PCI bus is only a secondary peripheral, rather than the actual arbiter "
"of device access. In particular, I got recording glitches during "
"simultaneous playback on an Intel DP55 board (memory controller in the CPU), "
"but had success with an Intel DP45 board (memory controller in the north "
"bridge)."

"88.2/96/176.4/192 kHz operation. It is not going to be upstreamed due to a "
"fundamental disagreement about what constitutes a good user experience."
