"The chip supports per-channel oversampling when SPI offload is being used, "

"Enabling oversampling on a channel raises the effective number of bits of "
"sampled data to 17 (OSR == 4), 18 (16), or 19 (64), respectively. This can "
"be set via the ``oversampling_ratio`` attribute."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../iio/ad4695.rst:191
msgid ""
"Setting the oversampling ratio for a channel also changes the sample rate "
"for that channel, since it requires multiple conversions per 1 sample. "
"Specifically, the new sampling frequency is the PWM sampling frequency "
"divided by the particular OSR. This is set automatically by the driver when "
"setting the ``oversampling_ratio`` attribute. For example, if the device's "
"current ``sampling_frequency`` is 10000 and an OSR of 4 is set on channel "
"``voltage0``, the new reported sampling rate for that channel will be 2500 "
"(ignoring PWM API rounding), while all others will remain at 10000.  "
"Subsequently setting the sampling frequency to a higher value on that "
"channel will adjust the CNV trigger period for all channels, e.g. if "
"``voltage0``'s sampling frequency is adjusted from 2500 (with an OSR of 4) "
"to 10000, the value reported by ``in_voltage0_sampling_frequency`` will be "
"10000, but all other channels will now report 40000."

"For simplicity, the sampling frequency of the device should be set "
"(considering the highest desired OSR value to be used) first, before "

"When SPI offload is used, the sample rate is configured per channel. All "

"rate determines the delay between each individual conversion, the effective "
"sample rate for each sample is actually the sum of the periods of each "
"enabled channel in a buffered read. In other words, it is the value of the "
"``in_voltageY_sampling_frequency`` attribute divided by the number of "
"enabled channels. So if 4 channels are enabled, with the "
"``in_voltageY_sampling_frequency`` attributes set to 1 MHz, the effective "
"sample rate is 250 kHz."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../iio/ad4695.rst:263
msgid ""
"With oversampling enabled, the effective sample rate also depends on the OSR "
"assigned to each channel. For example, if one of the 4 channels mentioned in "
"the previous case is configured with an OSR of 4, the effective sample rate "
"for that channel becomes (1 MHz / 4 ) = 250 kHz. The effective sample rate "
"for all four channels is then 1 / ( (3 / 1 MHz) + ( 1 / 250 kHz) ) ~= 142.9 "
"kHz. Note that in this case \"sample\" refers to one read of all enabled "
"channels (i.e. one full cycle through the auto-sequencer)."
