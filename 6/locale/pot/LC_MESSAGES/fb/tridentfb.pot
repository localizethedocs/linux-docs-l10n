"All families are accelerated. Only PCI/AGP based cards are supported, none "
"of the older Tridents. The driver supports 8, 16 and 32 bits per pixel "
"depths. The TGUI family requires a line length to be power of 2 if "
"acceleration is enabled. This means that range of possible resolutions and "
"bpp is limited comparing to the range if acceleration is disabled (see list "
"of parameters below)."
