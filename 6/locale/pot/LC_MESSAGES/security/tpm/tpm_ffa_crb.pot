"A TPM can be implemented as an FF-A secure service.  This could be a "
"firmware TPM or could potentially be a TPM service that acts as a proxy to a "
"discrete TPM chip. An FF-A based TPM abstracts hardware details (e.g. bus "
"controller and chip selects) away from the OS and can protect locality 4 "
"from access by an OS.  The TCG-defined CRB interface is used by clients to "
"interact with the TPM service."
