msgid ""
"High memory (highmem) is used when the size of physical memory approaches or "
"exceeds the maximum size of virtual memory.  At that point it becomes "
"impossible for the kernel to keep all of the available physical memory "
"mapped at all times.  This means the kernel needs to start using temporary "
"mappings of the pieces of physical memory that it wants to access."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../mm/highmem.rst:18
msgid ""
"The part of (physical) memory not covered by a permanent mapping is what we "
"refer to as 'highmem'.  There are various architecture dependent constraints "
"on where exactly that border lies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../mm/highmem.rst:22
msgid ""
"In the i386 arch, for example, we choose to map the kernel into every "
"process's VM space so that we don't have to pay the full TLB invalidation "
"costs for kernel entry/exit.  This means the available virtual memory space "
"(4GiB on i386) has to be divided between user and kernel space."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../mm/highmem.rst:27
msgid ""
"The traditional split for architectures using this approach is 3:1, 3GiB for "
"userspace and the top 1GiB for kernel space::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../mm/highmem.rst:38
msgid ""
"This means that the kernel can at most map 1GiB of physical memory at any "
"one time, but because we need virtual address space for other things - "
"including temporary maps to access the rest of the physical memory - the "
"actual direct map will typically be less (usually around ~896MiB)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../mm/highmem.rst:43

"Other architectures that have mm context tagged TLBs can have separate "
"kernel and user maps.  Some hardware (like some ARMs), however, have limited "

"kmap_local_page(), kmap_local_folio() - These functions are used to create "
"short term mappings. They can be invoked from any context (including "
"interrupts) but the mappings can only be used in the context which acquired "

"On CONFIG_HIGHMEM=n kernels and for low memory pages they return the virtual "
