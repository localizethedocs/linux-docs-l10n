"DAMON is a Linux kernel subsystem that provides a framework for data access "
"monitoring and the monitoring results based system operations.  The core "
"monitoring :ref:`mechanisms <damon_design_monitoring>` of DAMON make it"

"*accurate* (the monitoring output is useful enough for DRAM level memory "
"management; It might not appropriate for CPU Cache levels, though),"

"*light-weight* (the monitoring overhead is low enough to be applied online), "

"Using this framework, therefore, the kernel can operate system in an access-"
"aware fashion.  Because the features are also exposed to the :doc:`user "
"space </admin-guide/mm/damon/index>`, users who have special information "
"about their workloads can write personalized applications for better "
"understanding and optimizations of their workloads and systems."

"For easier development of such systems, DAMON provides a feature called :ref:"
"`DAMOS <damon_design_damos>` (DAMon-based Operation Schemes) in addition to "
"the monitoring.  Using the feature, DAMON users in both kernel and :doc:"
"`user spaces </admin-guide/mm/damon/index>` can do access-aware system "
"operations with no code but simple configurations."
