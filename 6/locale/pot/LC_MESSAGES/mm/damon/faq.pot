msgid ""
"No.  The core of the DAMON is address space independent.  The address space "
"specific monitoring operations including monitoring target regions "
"constructions and actual access checks can be implemented and configured on "
"the DAMON core by the users.  In this way, DAMON users can monitor any "
"address space with any access check technique."

"Nonetheless, DAMON provides vma/rmap tracking and PTE Accessed bit check "
"based implementations of the address space dependent functions for the "
"virtual memory and the physical memory by default, for a reference and "
"convenient use."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../mm/damon/faq.rst:24
msgid ""
"Yes.  You can do so by setting the ``min_nr_regions`` attribute higher than "
"the working set size divided by the page size.  Because the monitoring "
"target regions size is forced to be ``>=page size``, the region split will "
"make no effect."
