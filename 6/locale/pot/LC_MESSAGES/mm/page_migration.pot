"Page migration allows moving the physical location of pages between nodes in "
"a NUMA system while the process is running. This means that the virtual "
"addresses that the process sees do not change. However, the system "
"rearranges the physical location of those pages."

"The main intent of page migration is to reduce the latency of memory "
"accesses by moving pages near to the processor where the process accessing "

"Page migration allows a process to manually relocate the node on which its "
"pages are located through the MF_MOVE and MF_MOVE_ALL options while setting "
"a new memory policy via mbind(). The pages of a process can also be "
"relocated from another process using the sys_migrate_pages() function call. "
"The migrate_pages() function call takes two sets of nodes and moves pages of "
"a process that are located on the from nodes to the destination nodes. Page "
"migration functions are provided by the numactl package by Andi Kleen (a "
"version later than 0.9.3 is required. Get it from https://github.com/numactl/"
"numactl.git). numactl provides libnuma which provides an interface similar "
"to other NUMA functionality for page migration.  cat ``/proc/<pid>/"
"numa_maps`` allows an easy review of where the pages of a process are "
"located. See also the numa_maps documentation in the proc(5) man page."

"Manual migration is useful if for example the scheduler has relocated a "
"process to a processor on a distant node. A batch scheduler or an "
"administrator may detect the situation and move the pages of the process "
"nearer to the new processor. The kernel itself only provides manual page "
"migration support. Automatic page migration may be implemented through user "
"space processes that move pages. A special function call \"move_pages\" "
"allows the moving of individual pages within a process. For example, A NUMA "
"profiler may obtain a log showing frequent off-node accesses and may use the "
"result to move pages to more advantageous locations."

"Larger installations usually partition the system using cpusets into "
"sections of nodes. Paul Jackson has equipped cpusets with the ability to "
"move pages when a task is moved to another cpuset (See :ref:`CPUSETS "
"<cpusets>`). Cpusets allow the automation of process locality. If a task is "
"moved to a new cpuset then also all its pages are moved with it so that the "
"performance of the process does not sink dramatically. Also the pages of "
"processes in a cpuset are moved if the allowed memory nodes of a cpuset are "
"changed."

"Page migration allows the preservation of the relative location of pages "
"within a group of nodes for all migration techniques which will preserve a "

"process. This is necessary in order to preserve the memory latencies. "
