msgid ""
"This driver exposes all first-party and third-party Xbox compatible "
"controllers. It has a long history and has enjoyed considerable usage as "
"Windows' xinput library caused most PC games to focus on Xbox controller "
"compatibility."

"Due to backwards compatibility all buttons are reported as digital. This "
"only affects Original Xbox controllers. All later controller models have "
"only digital face buttons."

"Rumble is supported on some models of Xbox 360 controllers but not of "
"Original Xbox controllers nor on Xbox One controllers. As of writing the "
"Xbox One's rumble protocol has not been reverse-engineered but in the future "

"If you set dpad_to_buttons to N and you are using an unknown device the "

"All 8 axes work, though they all have the same range (-32768..32767) and the "

"For dance style pads (like the redoctane pad) several changes have been "

"up+down, making DDR style games unplayable."
