"The QMSS (Queue Manager Sub System) found on Keystone SOCs is one of the "
"main hardware sub system which forms the backbone of the Keystone multi-core "
"Navigator. QMSS consist of queue managers, packed-data structure "
"processors(PDSP), linking RAM, descriptor pools and infrastructure Packet "
"DMA. The Queue Manager is a hardware module that is responsible for "
"accelerating management of the packet queues. Packets are queued/de-queued "
"by writing or reading descriptor address to a particular memory mapped "
"location. The PDSPs perform QMSS related functions like accumulation, QoS, "
"or event management. Linking RAM registers are used to link the descriptors "
"which are stored in descriptor RAM. Descriptor RAM is configurable as "
"internal or external memory. The QMSS driver manages the PDSP setups, "
"linking RAM regions, queue pool management (allocation, push, pop and "
"notify) and descriptor pool management."
