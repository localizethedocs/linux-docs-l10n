"V-EIOINTC (Virtual Extended I/O Interrupt Controller) is an extension of "

"With standard EIOINTC, interrupt routing setting includes two parts: eight "
"bits for CPU selection and four bits for CPU IP (Interrupt Pin) selection. "
"For CPU selection there is four bits for EIOINTC node selection, four bits "
