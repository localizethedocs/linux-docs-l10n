"H_HTM is used as an interface for executing Hardware Trace Macro (HTM) "
"functions, including setup, configuration, control and dumping of the HTM "
"data. For using HTM, it is required to setup HTM buffers and HTM operations "
"can be controlled using the H_HTM hcall. The hcall can be invoked for any "
"core/chip of the system from within a partition itself. To use this feature, "
"a debugfs folder called \"htmdump\" is present under /sys/kernel/debug/"
"powerpc."
