"This document tries to explain the implementation of the KASLR for Freescale "
"BookE32. KASLR is a security feature that deters exploit attempts relying on "
"knowledge of the location of kernel internals."

"Since CONFIG_RELOCATABLE has already supported, what we need to do is map or "
"copy kernel to a proper place and relocate. Freescale Book-E parts expect "
"lowmem to be mapped by fixed TLB entries(TLB1). The TLB1 entries are not "
"suitable to map the kernel directly in a randomized region, so we chose to "
"copy the kernel to a proper place and restart to relocate."

"Entropy is derived from the banner and timer base, which will change every "

"We will use the first 512M of the low memory to randomize the kernel image. "
"The memory will be split in 64M zones. We will use the lower 8 bit of the "
"entropy to decide the index of the 64M zone. Then we chose a 16K aligned "
"offset inside the 64M zone to put the kernel in::"
