"The Hardware Feedback Interface provides to the operating system information "
"about the performance and energy efficiency of each CPU in the system. Each "
"capability is given as a unit-less quantity in the range [0-255]. Higher "
"values indicate higher capability. Energy efficiency and performance are "
"reported in separate capabilities. Even though on some systems these two "
"metrics may be related, they are specified as independent capabilities in "
"the Intel SDM."

"These capabilities may change at runtime as a result of changes in the "
"operating conditions of the system or the action of external factors. The "
"rate at which these capabilities are updated is specific to each processor "
"model. On some models, capabilities are set at boot time and never change. "
"On others, capabilities may change every tens of milliseconds. For instance, "
"a remote mechanism may be used to lower Thermal Design Power. Such change "
"can be reflected in the HFI. Likewise, if the system needs to be throttled "
"due to excessive heat, the HFI may reflect reduced performance on specific "
"CPUs."

"The kernel or a userspace policy daemon can use these capabilities to modify "
"task placement decisions. For instance, if either the performance or energy "
"capabilities of a given logical processor becomes zero, it is an indication "
"that the hardware recommends to the operating system to not schedule any "
"tasks on that processor for performance or energy efficiency reasons, "
"respectively."

"The infrastructure to handle thermal event interrupts has two parts. In the "
"Local Vector Table of a CPU's local APIC, there exists a register for the "
"Thermal Monitor Register. This register controls how interrupts are "
"delivered to a CPU when the thermal monitor generates and interrupt. Further "
"details can be found in the Intel SDM Vol. 3 Section 10.5 [1]_."

"The thermal monitor may generate interrupts per CPU or per package. The HFI "
"generates package-level interrupts. This monitor is configured and "
"initialized via a set of machine-specific registers. Specifically, the HFI "
"interrupt and status are controlled via designated bits in the "
"IA32_PACKAGE_THERM_INTERRUPT and IA32_PACKAGE_THERM_STATUS registers, "
"respectively. There exists one HFI table per package. Further details can be "

"The hardware issues an HFI interrupt after updating the HFI table and is "

"When servicing such interrupt, the HFI driver parses the updated table and "
"relays the update to userspace using the thermal notification framework. "
"Given that there may be many HFI updates every second, the updates relayed "
"to userspace are throttled at a rate of CONFIG_HZ jiffies."
