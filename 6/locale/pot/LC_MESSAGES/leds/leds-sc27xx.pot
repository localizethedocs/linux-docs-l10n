"Specify a hardware pattern for the SC27XX LED. For the SC27XX LED "
"controller, it only supports 4 stages to make a single hardware pattern, "
"which is used to configure the rise time, high time, fall time and low time "
"for the breathing mode."

"For the breathing mode, the SC27XX LED only expects one brightness for the "
"high stage. To be compatible with the hardware pattern format, we should set "
"brightness as 0 for rise stage, fall stage and low stage."

"Since the stage duration step is 125 ms, the duration should be a multiplier "
