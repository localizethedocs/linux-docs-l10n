"Contributions are welcome.  There are plenty of opportunities for visible, "
"important contributions to this module.  Here is a partial list of the known "
"problems and missing features:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:15
msgid ""
"SMB3 (and SMB3.1.1) missing optional features: multichannel performance "
"optimizations, algorithmic channel selection, directory leases "
"optimizations, support for faster packet signing (GMAC), support for "
"compression over the network, T10 copy offload ie \"ODX\" (copy chunk, and "
"\"Duplicate Extents\" ioctl are currently the only two server side copy "
"mechanisms supported)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:23
msgid ""
"Better optimized compounding and error handling for sparse file support, "
"perhaps addition of new optional SMB3.1.1 fsctls to make collapse range and "
"insert range more atomic"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:27
msgid ""
"Support for SMB3.1.1 over QUIC (and perhaps other socket based protocols "
"like SCTP)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:30
msgid ""
"quota support (needs minor kernel change since quota calls otherwise won't "
"make it to network filesystems or deviceless filesystems)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:33
msgid ""
"Additional use cases can be optimized to use \"compounding\" (e.g. open/"
"query/close and open/setinfo/close) to reduce the number of roundtrips to "
"the server and improve performance. Various cases (stat, statfs, create, "
"unlink, mkdir, xattrs) already have been improved by using compounding but "
"more can be done. In addition we could significantly reduce redundant opens "
"by using deferred close (with handle caching leases) and better using "
"reference counters on file handles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:42
msgid ""
"Finish inotify support so kde and gnome file list windows will autorefresh "
"(partially complete by Asser). Needs minor kernel vfs change to support "
"removing D_NOTIFY on a file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:46

"Add GUI tool to configure /proc/fs/cifs settings and for display of the CIFS "
"statistics (started)"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:49
msgid ""
"implement support for security and trusted categories of xattrs (requires "
"minor protocol extension) to enable better support for SELINUX"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:52
msgid ""
"Add support for tree connect contexts (see MS-SMB2) a new SMB3.1.1 protocol "
"feature (may be especially useful for virtualization)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:55
msgid ""
"Create UID mapping facility so server UIDs can be mapped on a per mount or a "
"per server basis to client UIDs or nobody if no mapping exists. Also better "
"integration with winbind for resolving SID owners"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cifs/todo.rst:59
msgid ""
"Add tools to take advantage of more smb3 specific ioctls and features "
"(passthrough ioctl/fsctl is now implemented in cifs.ko to allow sending "
"various SMB3 fsctls and query info and set info calls directly from user "
"space) Add tools to make setting various non-POSIX metadata attributes "
"easier from tools (e.g. extending what was done in smb-info tool)."
