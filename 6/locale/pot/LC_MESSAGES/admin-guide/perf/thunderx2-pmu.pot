"The ThunderX2 SoC PMU consists of independent, system-wide, per-socket PMUs "
"such as the Level 3 Cache (L3C), DDR4 Memory Controller (DMC) and Cavium "
"Coherent Processor Interconnect (CCPI2)."

"The DMC has 8 interleaved channels and the L3C has 16 interleaved tiles. "
"Events are counted for the default channel (i.e. channel 0) and prorated to "
"the total number of channels/tiles."

msgid ""
"The DMC and L3C support up to 4 counters, while the CCPI2 supports up to 8 "
"counters. Counters are independently programmable to different events and "
"can be started and stopped individually. None of the counters support an "
"overflow interrupt. DMC and L3C counters are 32-bit and read every 2 "
"seconds. The CCPI2 counters are 64-bit and assumed not to overflow in normal "
"operation."

"The thunderx2_pmu driver registers per-socket perf PMUs for the DMC and L3C "
"devices.  Each PMU can be used to count up to 4 (DMC/L3C) or up to 8 (CCPI2) "
"events simultaneously. The PMUs provide a description of their available "
"events and configuration options under sysfs, see /sys/bus/event_source/"
"devices/uncore_<l3c_S/dmc_S/ccpi2_S/>; S is the socket id."
