"Zswap is a lightweight compressed cache for swap pages. It takes pages that "
"are in the process of being swapped out and attempts to compress them into a "
"dynamically allocated RAM-based memory pool.  zswap basically trades CPU "
"cycles for potentially reduced swap I/O.  This trade-off can also result in "
"a significant performance improvement if reads from the compressed cache are "
"faster than reads from a swap device."

"Zswap makes use of zpool for the managing the compressed memory pool.  Each "
"allocation in zpool is not directly accessible by address.  Rather, a handle "
"is returned by the allocation routine and that handle must be mapped before "
"being accessed.  The compressed memory pool grows on demand and shrinks as "
"compressed pages are freed.  The pool is not preallocated.  By default, a "
"zpool of type selected in ``CONFIG_ZSWAP_ZPOOL_DEFAULT`` Kconfig option is "
"created, but it can be overridden at boot time by setting the ``zpool`` "
"attribute, e.g. ``zswap.zpool=zsmalloc``. It can also be changed at runtime "
