"This tool's objective is to help the development and testing of userspace "
"applications that use the V4L2 stateless API to decode media."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/visl.rst:12
msgid ""
"A userspace implementation can use visl to run a decoding loop even when no "
"hardware is available or when the kernel uAPI for the codec has not been "
"upstreamed yet. This can reveal bugs at an early stage."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/visl.rst:16
msgid ""
"This driver can also trace the contents of the V4L2 controls submitted to "
"it.  It can also dump the contents of the vb2 buffers through a debugfs "
"interface. This is in many ways similar to the tracing infrastructure "
"available for other popular encode/decode APIs out there and can help "
"develop a userspace application by using another (working) one as a "
"reference."

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/visl.rst:25
msgid ""
"No actual decoding of video frames is performed by visl. The V4L2 test "
"pattern generator is used to write various debug information to the capture "
"buffers instead."

msgid "Module parameters"

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/visl.rst:32
msgid ""
"visl_debug: Activates debug info, printing various debug messages through "
"dprintk. Also controls whether per-frame debug info is shown. Defaults to "
"off. Note that enabling this feature can result in slow performance through "
"serial."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/visl.rst:36
msgid ""
"visl_transtime_ms: Simulated process time in milliseconds. Slowing down the "
"decoding speed can be useful for debugging."

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/visl.rst:39
msgid ""
"visl_dprintk_frame_start, visl_dprintk_frame_nframes: Dictates a range of "
"frames where dprintk is activated. This only controls the dprintk tracing on "
"a per-frame basis. Note that printing a lot of data can be slow through "
"serial."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/visl.rst:43
msgid ""
"keep_bitstream_buffers: Controls whether bitstream (i.e. OUTPUT) buffers are "
"kept after a decoding session. Defaults to false so as to reduce the amount "
"of clutter. keep_bitstream_buffers == false works well when live debugging "
"the client program with GDB."
msgstr ""

"bitstream_trace_frame_start, bitstream_trace_nframes: Similar to "

"tpg_verbose: Write extra information on each output frame to ease debugging "

"Even though no video decoding is actually done, the output frames can be "

"Depending on the tpg_verbose parameter value, information on reference "
"frames, their timestamps, the status of the OUTPUT and CAPTURE queues and "
