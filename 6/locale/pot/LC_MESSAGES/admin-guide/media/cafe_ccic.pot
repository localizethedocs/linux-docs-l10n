"\"cafe_ccic\" is a driver for the Marvell 88ALP01 \"cafe\" CMOS camera "
"controller.  This is the controller found in first-generation OLPC systems, "
"and this driver was written with support from the OLPC project."

"Current status: the core driver works.  It can generate data in YUV422, "
"RGB565, and RGB444 formats.  (Anybody looking at the code will see RGB32 as "
"well, but that is a debugging aid which will be removed shortly).  VGA and "
"QVGA modes work; CIF is there but the colors remain funky.  Only the OV7670 "
"sensor is known to work with this controller at this time."

"alloc_bufs_at_load:  Normally, the driver will not allocate any DMA buffers "
"until the time comes to transfer data.  If this option is set, then worst-"
"case-sized buffers will be allocated at module load time. This option nails "
"down the memory for the life of the module, but perhaps decreases the "
"chances of an allocation failure later on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/cafe_ccic.rst:42
msgid ""
"dma_buf_size: The size of DMA buffers to allocate.  Note that this option is "
"only consulted for load-time allocation; when buffers are allocated at run "
"time, they will be sized appropriately for the current camera settings."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/cafe_ccic.rst:47
msgid ""
"n_dma_bufs: The controller can cycle through either two or three DMA "
"buffers.  Normally, the driver tries to use three buffers; on faster "
"systems, however, it will work well with only two."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/media/cafe_ccic.rst:51
msgid ""
"min_buffers: The minimum number of streaming I/O buffers that the driver "
"will consent to work with.  Default is one, but, on slower systems, better "
"behavior with mplayer can be achieved by setting to a higher value (like "
"six)."
msgstr ""

"max_buffers: The maximum number of streaming I/O buffers; default is ten.  "
"That number was carefully picked out of a hat and should not be assumed to "
"actually mean much of anything."

"flip: If this boolean parameter is set, the sensor will be instructed to "
"invert the video image.  Whether it makes sense is determined by how your "
"particular camera is mounted."
