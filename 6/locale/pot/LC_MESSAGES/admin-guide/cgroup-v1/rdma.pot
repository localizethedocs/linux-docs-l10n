"Currently user space applications can easily take away all the rdma verb "
"specific resources such as AH, CQ, QP, MR etc. Due to which other "
"applications in other cgroup or kernel space ULPs may not even get chance to "
"allocate any rdma resources. This can lead to service unavailability."

"Therefore RDMA controller is needed through which resource consumption of "

"RDMA cgroup allows limit configuration of resources. Rdma cgroup maintains "
"resource accounting per cgroup, per device using resource pool structure. "
"Each such resource pool is limited up to 64 resources in given resource pool "
"by rdma cgroup, which can be extended later if required."

"This resource pool object is linked to the cgroup css. Typically there are 0 "
"to 4 resource pool instances per cgroup, per device in most use cases. But "
"nothing limits to have it more. At present hundreds of RDMA devices per "
"single cgroup may not be handled optimally, however there is no known use "
"case or requirement for such configuration either."

"Since RDMA resources can be allocated from any process and can be freed by "
"any of the child processes which shares the address space, rdma resources "
"are always owned by the creator cgroup css. This allows process migration "
"from one to other cgroup without major complexity of transferring resource "
"ownership; because such ownership is not really present due to shared nature "
"of rdma resources. Linking resources around css also ensures that cgroups "
"can be deleted after processes migrated. This allow progress migration as "
"well with active resources, even though that is not a primary use case."

"Whenever RDMA resource charging occurs, owner rdma cgroup is returned to the "
"caller. Same rdma cgroup should be passed while uncharging the resource. "
"This also allows process migrated with active RDMA resource to charge to new "
"owner cgroup for new resource. It also allows to uncharge resource of a "
"process from previously charged cgroup which is migrated to new cgroup, even "
"though that is not a primary use case."

"Resource pool object is created in following situations. (a) User sets the "

"charge the resource. So that it correctly uncharge them when applications "
"are running without limits and later on when limits are enforced during "
"uncharging, otherwise usage count will drop to negative."
