"LoadPin is a Linux Security Module that ensures all kernel-loaded files "
"(modules, firmware, etc) all originate from the same filesystem, with the "
"expectation that such a filesystem is backed by a read-only device such as "
"dm-verity or CDROM. This allows systems that have a verified and/or "
"unchangeable filesystem to enforce module and firmware loading restrictions "
"without needing to sign the files individually."

"The LSM is selectable at build-time with ``CONFIG_SECURITY_LOADPIN``, and "
"can be controlled at boot-time with the kernel command line option "
"\"``loadpin.enforce``\". By default, it is enabled, but can be disabled at "
"boot (\"``loadpin.enforce=0``\")."

"LoadPin starts pinning when it sees the first file loaded. If the block "
"device backing the filesystem is not read-only, a sysctl is created to "
"toggle pinning: ``/proc/sys/kernel/loadpin/enabled``. (Having a mutable "
"filesystem means pinning is mutable too, but having the sysctl allows for "
"easy testing on systems with a mutable filesystem.)"

"It's also possible to exclude specific file types from LoadPin using kernel "
"command line option \"``loadpin.exclude``\". By default, all files are "
"included, but they can be excluded using kernel command line option such as "
"\"``loadpin.exclude=kernel-module,kexec-image``\". This allows to use "
"different mechanisms such as ``CONFIG_MODULE_SIG`` and "
"``CONFIG_KEXEC_VERIFY_SIG`` to verify kernel module and kernel image while "
"still use LoadPin to protect the integrity of other files kernel loads. The "
"full list of valid file types can be found in ``kernel_read_file_str`` "
"defined in ``include/linux/kernel_read_file.h``."
