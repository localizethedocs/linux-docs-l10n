"The Linux Security Module (LSM) framework provides a mechanism for various "
"security checks to be hooked by new kernel extensions. The name \"module\" "
"is a bit of a misnomer since these extensions are not actually loadable "
"kernel modules. Instead, they are selectable at build-time via "
"CONFIG_DEFAULT_SECURITY and can be overridden at boot-time via the "
"``\"security=...\"`` kernel command line argument, in the case where "
"multiple LSMs were built into a given kernel."

"The primary users of the LSM interface are Mandatory Access Control (MAC) "
"extensions which provide a comprehensive security policy. Examples include "
"SELinux, Smack, Tomoyo, and AppArmor. In addition to the larger MAC "
"extensions, other extensions can be built using the LSM to provide specific "
"changes to system operation when these tweaks are not available in the core "
"functionality of Linux itself."

"The Linux capabilities modules will always be included. This may be followed "
"by any number of \"minor\" modules and at most one \"major\" module. For "
"more details on capabilities, see ``capabilities(7)`` in the Linux man-pages "
"project."

"A list of the active security modules can be found by reading ``/sys/kernel/"
"security/lsm``. This is a comma separated list, and will always include the "
"capability module. The list reflects the order in which checks are made. The "
"capability module will always be first, followed by any \"minor\" modules (e."
"g. Yama) and then the one \"major\" module (e.g. SELinux) if there is one "
"configured."

"Process attributes associated with \"major\" security modules should be "
"accessed and maintained using the special files in ``/proc/.../attr``. A "
"security module may maintain a module specific subdirectory there, named "
"after the module. ``/proc/.../attr/smack`` is provided by the Smack security "
"module and contains all its special files. The files directly in ``/proc/.../"
"attr`` remain as legacy interfaces for modules that provide subdirectories."
