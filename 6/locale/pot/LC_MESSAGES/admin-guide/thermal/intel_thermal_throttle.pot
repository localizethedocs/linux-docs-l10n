"In general, there are two mechanisms to control the core temperature of the "

"The status of the temperature sensor that triggers the thermal monitor (TM1/"
"TM2) is indicated through the \"thermal status flag\" and \"thermal status "
"log flag\" in MSR_IA32_THERM_STATUS for core level and "
"MSR_IA32_PACKAGE_THERM_STATUS for package level."

"Thermal Status flag, bit 0 — When set, indicates that the processor core "
"temperature is currently at the trip temperature of the thermal monitor and "
"that the processor power consumption is being reduced via either TM1 or TM2, "
"depending on which is enabled. When clear, the flag indicates that the core "
"temperature is below the thermal monitor trip temperature. This flag is read "
"only."

"Thermal Status Log flag, bit 1 — When set, indicates that the thermal sensor "
"has tripped since the last power-up or reset or since the last time that "
"software cleared this flag. This flag is a sticky bit; once set it remains "
"set until cleared by software or until a power-up or reset of the processor. "
"The default state is clear."

"It is possible that when user reads MSR_IA32_THERM_STATUS or "
"MSR_IA32_PACKAGE_THERM_STATUS, TM1/TM2 is not active. In this case, "
"\"Thermal Status flag\" will read \"0\" and the \"Thermal Status Log flag\" "
"will be set to show any previous \"TM1/TM2\" activation. But since it needs "
"to be cleared by the software, it can't show the number of occurrences of "
"\"TM1/TM2\" activations."

"Hence, Linux provides counters of how many times the \"Thermal Status flag\" "
"was set. Also presents how long the \"Thermal Status flag\" was active in "
"milliseconds. Using these counters, users can check if the performance was "
"limited because of thermal events. It is recommended to read from sysfs "
"instead of directly reading MSRs as the \"Thermal Status Log flag\" is reset "
"by the driver to implement rate control."
