"``amd-pstate`` is the AMD CPU performance scaling driver that introduces a "
"new CPU frequency control mechanism on modern AMD APU and CPU series in "
"Linux kernel. The new mechanism is based on Collaborative Processor "
"Performance Control (CPPC) which provides finer grain frequency management "
"than legacy ACPI hardware P-States. Current AMD CPU/APU platforms are using "
"the ACPI P-states driver to manage CPU frequency and clocks with switching "
"only in 3 P-states. CPPC replaces the ACPI P-states controls and allows a "
"flexible, low-latency interface for the Linux kernel to directly communicate "
"the performance hints to hardware."

"Volume 2: System Programming [1]_). Currently, ``amd-pstate`` supports basic "
