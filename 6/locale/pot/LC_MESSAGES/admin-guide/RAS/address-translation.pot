"Zen-based AMD systems include a Data Fabric that manages the layout of "
"physical memory. Devices attached to the Fabric, like memory controllers, I/"
"O, etc., may not have a complete view of the system physical memory map. "
"These devices may provide a \"normalized\", i.e. device physical, address "
"when reporting memory errors. Normalized addresses must be translated to a "
"system physical address for the kernel to action on the memory."
