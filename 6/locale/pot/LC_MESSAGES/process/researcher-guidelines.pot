"The Linux kernel community welcomes transparent research on the Linux "
"kernel, the activities involved in producing it, and any other byproducts of "
"its development. Linux benefits greatly from this kind of research, and most "
"aspects of Linux are driven by research in one form or another."

msgid ""
"The community greatly appreciates if researchers can share preliminary "
"findings before making their results public, especially if such research "
"involves security. Getting involved early helps both improve the quality of "
"research and ability for Linux to improve from it. In any case, sharing open "
"access copies of the published research with the community is recommended."

"This document seeks to clarify what the Linux kernel community considers "
"acceptable and non-acceptable practices when conducting such research. At "
"the very least, such research and related activities should follow standard "
"research ethics rules. For more background on research ethics generally, "
"ethics in technology, and research of developer communities in particular, "

"The Linux kernel community expects that everyone interacting with the "
"project is participating in good faith to make Linux better. Research on any "
"publicly-available artifact (including, but not limited to source code) "
"produced by the Linux kernel community is welcome, though research on "
"developers must be distinctly opt-in."

"Passive research that is based entirely on publicly available sources, "
"including posts to public mailing lists and commits to public repositories, "
"is clearly permissible. Though, as with any research, standard ethics must "
"still be followed."

"Active research on developer behavior, however, must be done with the "
"explicit agreement of, and full disclosure to, the individual developers "
"involved. Developers cannot be interacted with/experimented on without "
"consent; this, too, is standard research ethics."

msgid ""
"Research often takes the form of surveys sent to maintainers or "
"contributors.  As a general rule, though, the kernel community derives "
"little value from these surveys.  The kernel development process works "
"because every developer benefits from their participation, even working with "
"others who have different goals.  Responding to a survey, though, is a one-"
"way demand placed on busy developers with no corresponding benefit to "
"themselves or to the kernel community as a whole.  For this reason, this "
"method of research is discouraged."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/researcher-guidelines.rst:59
msgid ""
"Kernel community members already receive far too much email and are likely "
"to perceive survey requests as just another demand on their time.  Sending "
"such requests deprives the community of valuable contributor time and is "
"unlikely to yield a statistically useful response."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../process/researcher-guidelines.rst:64
msgid ""
"As an alternative, researchers should consider attending developer events, "
"hosting sessions where the research project and its benefits to the "
"participants can be explained, and interacting directly with the community "
"there.  The information received will be far richer than that obtained from "
"an email survey, and the community will gain from the ability to learn from "
"your insights as well."

msgid ""
"To help clarify: sending patches to developers *is* interacting with them, "
"but they have already consented to receiving *good faith contributions*. "
"Sending intentionally flawed/vulnerable patches or contributing misleading "
"information to discussions is not consented to. Such communication can be "
"damaging to the developer (e.g. draining time, effort, and morale) and "
"damaging to the project by eroding the entire developer community's trust in "
"the contributor (and the contributor's organization as a whole), undermining "
"efforts to provide constructive feedback to contributors, and putting end "
"users at risk of software flaws."

"When engaging with the developer community, sending a patch has "
