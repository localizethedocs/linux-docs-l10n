"Linux kernel developers take security very seriously.  As such, we'd like to "
"know when a security bug is found so that it can be fixed and disclosed as "
"quickly as possible.  Please report security bugs to the Linux kernel "
"security team."

"The security team and maintainers almost always require additional "
"information beyond what was initially provided in a report and rely on "
"active and efficient collaboration with the reporter to perform further "
"testing (e.g., verifying versions, configuration options, mitigations, or "
"patches). Before contacting the security team, the reporter must ensure they "
"are available to explain their findings, engage in discussions, and run "
"additional tests.  Reports where the reporter does not respond promptly or "
"cannot effectively discuss their findings may be abandoned if the "
"communication does not quickly improve."

"As it is with any bug, the more information provided the easier it will be "
"to diagnose and fix.  Please review the procedure outlined in 'Documentation/"
"admin-guide/reporting-issues.rst' if you are unclear about what information "
"is helpful.  Any exploit code is very helpful and will not be released "
"without consent from the reporter unless it has already been made public."

"org>.  This is a private list of security officers who will help verify the "
"bug report and develop and release a fix. If you already have a fix, please "
"include it with your report, as that can speed up the process considerably.  "
"It is possible that the security team will bring in extra help from area "
"maintainers to understand and fix the security vulnerability."

"Please send plain text emails without attachments where possible. It is much "
"harder to have a context-quoted discussion about a complex issue if all the "
"details are hidden away in attachments.  Think of it like a :doc:`regular "
"patch submission <../process/submitting-patches>` (even if you don't have a "
"patch yet): describe the problem and impact, list reproduction steps, and "
"follow it with a proposed fix, all in plain text."

"Although our preference is to release fixes for publicly undisclosed bugs as "
"soon as they become available, this may be postponed at the request of the "
"reporter or an affected party for up to 7 calendar days from the start of "
"the release process, with an exceptional extension to 14 calendar days if it "
"is agreed that the criticality of the bug requires more time.  The only "
"valid reason for deferring the publication of a fix is to accommodate the "
"logistics of QA and large scale rollouts which require release coordination."

"While embargoed information may be shared with trusted individuals in order "

"discussions (if any), exploits, CVE information or the identity of the "
"reporter."

"While the kernel security team solely focuses on getting bugs fixed, other "
"groups focus on fixing issues in distros and coordinating disclosure between "
"operating system vendors.  Coordination is usually handled by the \"linux-"
"distros\" mailing list and disclosure by the public \"oss-security\" mailing "
"list, both of which are closely related and presented in the linux-distros "
"wiki: <https://oss-security.openwall.org/wiki/mailing-lists/distros>"

"Please note that the respective policies and rules are different since the 3 "
"lists pursue different goals.  Coordinating between the kernel security team "
"and other teams is difficult since for the kernel security team occasional "
"embargoes (as subject to a maximum allowed number of days) start from the "
"availability of a fix, while for \"linux-distros\" they start from the "
"initial post to the list regardless of the availability of a fix."

"As such, the kernel security team strongly recommends that as a reporter of "
"a potential security issue you DO NOT contact the \"linux-distros\" mailing "
"list UNTIL a fix is accepted by the affected code's maintainers and you have "
"read the distros wiki page above and you fully understand the requirements "
"that contacting \"linux-distros\" will impose on you and the kernel "
"community.  This also means that in general it doesn't make sense to Cc: "
"both lists at once, except maybe for coordination if and while an accepted "
"fix has not yet been merged.  In other words, until a fix is accepted do not "
"Cc: \"linux-distros\", and after it's merged do not Cc: the kernel security "
"team."
