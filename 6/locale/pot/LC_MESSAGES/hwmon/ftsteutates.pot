"The BMC Teutates is the Eleventh generation of Superior System monitoring "
"and thermal management solution. It is builds on the basic functionality of "
"the BMC Theseus and contains several new features and enhancements. It can "
"monitor up to 4 voltages, 16 temperatures and 8 fans. It also contains an "
"integrated watchdog which is currently implemented in this driver."

"The ``pwmX_auto_channels_temp`` attributes show which temperature sensor is "
"currently driving which fan channel. This value might dynamically change "
"during runtime depending on the temperature sensor selected by the fan "
"control circuit."

"The 4 voltages require a board-specific multiplier, since the BMC can only "
"measure voltages up to 3.3V and thus relies on voltage dividers. Consult "
"your motherboard manual for details."
