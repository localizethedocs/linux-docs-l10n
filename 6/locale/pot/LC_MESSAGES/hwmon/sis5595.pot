msgid ""
"The SiS5595 southbridge has integrated hardware monitor functions. It also "
"has an I2C bus, but this driver only supports the hardware monitor. For the "
"I2C bus driver see i2c-sis5595."
msgstr ""

"The SiS5595 implements zero or one temperature sensor, two fan speed "
"sensors, four or five voltage sensors, and alarms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/sis5595.rst:78
msgid ""
"On the first version of the chip, there are four voltage sensors and one "
"temperature sensor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/sis5595.rst:81
msgid ""
"On the second version of the chip, the temperature sensor (temp) and the "
"fifth voltage sensor (in4) share a pin which is configurable, but not "
"through the driver. Sorry. The driver senses the configuration of the pin, "
"which was hopefully set by the BIOS."

"Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. An alarm is triggered once "
"when the max is crossed; it is also triggered when it drops below the min "
"value. Measurements are guaranteed between -55 and +125 degrees, with a "
"resolution of 1 degree."

#: ../../../hwmon/sis5595.rst:91
msgid ""
"Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is "
"triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. Fan "
"readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4 or 8) to give the "
"readings more range or accuracy. Not all RPM values can accurately be "
"represented, so some rounding is done. With a divider of 2, the lowest "
"representable value is around 2600 RPM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/sis5595.rst:98
msgid ""
"Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in volts. An "
"alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum or "
"maximum limit. Note that minimum in this case always means 'closest to "
"zero'; this is important for negative voltage measurements. All voltage "
"inputs can measure voltages between 0 and 4.08 volts, with a resolution of "
"0.016 volt."

"In addition to the alarms described above, there is a BTI alarm, which gets "
"triggered when an external chip has crossed its limits. Usually, this is "

"bit gets set."

"If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register "
"is read at least once. This means that the cause for the alarm may already "
"have disappeared! Note that in the current implementation, all hardware "
"registers are read whenever any data is read (unless it is less than 1.5 "
"seconds since the last update). This means that you can easily miss once-"
"only alarms."
