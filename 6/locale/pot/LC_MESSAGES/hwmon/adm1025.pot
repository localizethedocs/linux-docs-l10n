"(This is from Analog Devices.) The ADM1025 is a complete system hardware "
"monitor for microprocessor-based systems, providing measurement and limit "
"comparison of various system parameters. Five voltage measurement inputs are "
"provided, for monitoring +2.5V, +3.3V, +5V and +12V power supplies and the "
"processor core voltage. The ADM1025 can monitor a sixth power-supply voltage "
"by measuring its own VCC. One input (two pins) is dedicated to a remote "
"temperature-sensing diode and an on-chip temperature sensor allows ambient "
"temperature to be monitored."

"One specificity of this chip is that the pin 11 can be hardwired in two "
"different manners. It can act as the +12V power-supply voltage analog input, "
"or as the a fifth digital entry for the VID reading (bit 4). It's kind of "
"strange since both are useful, and the reason for designing the chip that "
"way is obscure at least to me. The bit 5 of the configuration register can "
"be used to define how the chip is hardwired. Please note that it is not a "
"choice you have to make as the user. The choice was already made by your "
"motherboard's maker. If the configuration bit isn't set properly, you'll "
"have a wrong +12V reading or a wrong VID reading. The way the driver handles "
"that is to preserve this bit through the initialization process, assuming "
"that the BIOS set it up properly beforehand. If it turns out not to be true "
"in some cases, we'll provide a module parameter to force modes."

"This driver also supports the ADM1025A, which differs from the ADM1025 only "
"in that it has \"open-drain VID inputs while the ADM1025 has on-chip 100k "
"pull-ups on the VID inputs\". It doesn't make any difference for us."
