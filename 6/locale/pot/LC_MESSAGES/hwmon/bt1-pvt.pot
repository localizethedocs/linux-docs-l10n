"This driver implements support for the hardware monitoring capabilities of "
"the embedded into Baikal-T1 process, voltage and temperature sensors. PVT IP-"
"core consists of one temperature and four voltage sensors, which can be used "
"to monitor the chip internal environment like heating, supply voltage and "
"transistors performance. The driver can optionally provide the hwmon alarms "
"for each sensor the PVT controller supports. The alarms functionality is "
"made compile-time configurable due to the hardware interface implementation "
"peculiarity, which is connected with an ability to convert data from only "
"one sensor at a time. Additional limitation is that the controller performs "
"the thresholds checking synchronously with the data conversion procedure. "
"Due to these in order to have the hwmon alarms automatically detected the "
"driver code must switch from one sensor to another, read converted data and "
"manually check the threshold status bits. Depending on the measurements "
"timeout settings (update_interval sysfs node value) this design may cause "
"additional burden on the system performance. So in case if alarms are "
"unnecessary in your system design it's recommended to have them disabled to "
"prevent the PVT IRQs being periodically raised to get the data cache/alarms "
"status up to date. By default in alarm-less configuration the data "
"conversion is performed by the driver on demand when read operation is "
"requested via corresponding _input-file."
