"This chip is known to be used in the Zyxel NSA320 and NSA325 NAS Units and "
"also in some variants of the NSA310 but the driver has only been tested on "
"the NSA320. In all of these devices it is connected to the same 3 GPIO lines "
"which are used to provide chip select, clock and data lines. The interface "
"behaves similarly to SPI but at much lower speeds than are normally used for "
"SPI."

"Following each chip select pulse the chip will generate a single 32 bit word "
"that contains 0x55 as a marker to indicate that data is being read "
"correctly, followed by an 8 bit fan speed in 100s of RPM and a 16 bit "
"temperature in tenths of a degree."

"The access timings used in the driver are the same as used in the Zyxel "
"provided kernel. Testing has shown that if the delay between chip select and "
"the first clock pulse is reduced from 100 ms to just under 10ms then the "
"chip will not produce any output. If the duration of either phase of the "
"clock is reduced from 100 us to less than 15 us then data pulses are likely "
"to be read twice corrupting the output. The above analysis is based upon a "
"sample of one unit but suggests that the Zyxel provided delay values include "
"a reasonable tolerance."

"The driver incorporates a limit that it will not check for updated values "
"faster than once a second. This is because the hardware takes a relatively "
"long time to read the data from the device and when it does it reads both "
"temp and fan speed. As the most likely case for two accesses in quick "
"succession is to read both of these values avoiding a second read delay is "
"desirable."
