"The DS620 is a (one instance) digital thermometer and thermostat. It has "
"both high and low temperature limits which can be user defined (i.e.  "
"programmed into non-volatile on-chip registers). Temperature range is -55 "
"degree Celsius to +125. Between 0 and 70 degree Celsius, accuracy is 0.5 "
"Kelvin. The value returned via sysfs displays post decimal positions."

"The thermostat function works as follows: When configured via platform_data "
"(struct ds620_platform_data) .pomode == 0 (default), the thermostat output "
"pin PO is always low. If .pomode == 1, the thermostat is in PO_LOW mode. I."
"e., the output pin PO becomes active when the temperature falls below "
"temp1_min and stays active until the temperature goes above temp1_max."

"Likewise, with .pomode == 2, the thermostat is in PO_HIGH mode. I.e., the PO "
