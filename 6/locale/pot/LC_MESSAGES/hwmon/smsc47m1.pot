"Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is "
"triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. Fan "
"readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4 or 8) to give the "
"readings more range or accuracy. Not all RPM values can accurately be "
"represented, so some rounding is done. With a divider of 2, the lowest "
"representable value is around 2600 RPM."

"If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register "
"is read at least once. This means that the cause for the alarm may already "
"have disappeared! Note that in the current implementation, all hardware "
"registers are read whenever any data is read (unless it is less than 1.5 "
"seconds since the last update). This means that you can easily miss once-"
"only alarms."
