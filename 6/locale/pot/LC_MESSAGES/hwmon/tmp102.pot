"The Texas Instruments TMP102 implements one temperature sensor.  Limits can "
"be set through the Overtemperature Shutdown register and Hysteresis "
"register.  The sensor is accurate to 0.5 degree over the range of -25 to +85 "
"C, and to 1.0 degree from -40 to +125 C. Resolution of the sensor is 0.0625 "
"degree.  The operating temperature has a minimum of -55 C and a maximum of "
"+150 C."
