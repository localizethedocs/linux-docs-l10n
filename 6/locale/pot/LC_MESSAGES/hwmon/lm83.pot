"The LM83 is a digital temperature sensor. It senses its own temperature as "
"well as the temperature of up to three external diodes. The LM82 is a "
"stripped down version of the LM83 that only supports one external diode. "
"Both are compatible with many other devices such as the LM84 and all other "
"ADM1021 clones. The main difference between the LM83 and the LM84 in that "
"the later can only sense the temperature of one external diode."

"The fact that the LM83 is only scarcely used can be easily explained. Most "
"motherboards come with more than just temperature sensors for health "
"monitoring. They also have voltage and fan rotation speed sensors. This "
"means that temperature-only chips are usually used as secondary chips "
"coupled with another chip such as an IT8705F or similar chip, which provides "
"more features. Since systems usually need three temperature sensors "
"(motherboard, processor, power supply) and primary chips provide some "
"temperature sensors, the secondary chip, if needed, won't have to handle "
"more than two temperatures. Thus, ADM1021 clones are sufficient, and there "
"is no need for a four temperatures sensor chip such as the LM83. The only "
"case where using an LM83 would make sense is on SMP systems, such as the "
"above-mentioned Iwill MPX2, because you want an additional temperature "
"sensor for each additional CPU."

"On the SBS P014, this is different, since the LM83 is the only hardware "
"monitoring chipset. One temperature sensor is used for the motherboard "
"(actually measuring the LM83's own temperature), one is used for the CPU. "
"The two other sensors must be used to measure the temperature of two other "
"points of the motherboard. We suspect these points to be the north and south "
"bridges, but this couldn't be confirmed."

"All temperature values are given in degrees Celsius. Local temperature is "
