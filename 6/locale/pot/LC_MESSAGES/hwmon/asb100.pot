"The ASB100 implements seven voltage sensors, three fan rotation speed "
"sensors, four temperature sensors, VID lines and alarms. In addition to "
"these, the ASB100-A also implements a single PWM controller for fans 2 and 3 "
"(i.e. one setting controls both.) If you have a plain ASB100, the PWM "
"controller will simply not work (or maybe it will for you... it doesn't for "
"me)."
