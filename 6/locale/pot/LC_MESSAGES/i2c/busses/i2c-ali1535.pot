"This is the driver for the SMB Host controller on Acer Labs Inc. (ALI) M1535 "

"The M1535 is a South bridge for portable systems. It is very similar to the "
"M15x3 South bridges also produced by Acer Labs Inc.  Some of the registers "
"within the part have moved and some have been redefined slightly. "
"Additionally, the sequencing of the SMBus transactions has been modified to "
"be more consistent with the sequencing recommended by the manufacturer and "
"observed through testing.  These changes are reflected in this driver and "
"can be identified by comparing this driver to the i2c-ali15x3 driver. For an "
"overview of these chips see http://www.acerlabs.com"

"The whole M7101 device has to be enabled for the SMB to work. You can't just "
