"In XE we avoid all of this complication by not allowing a BO list to be "
"passed into an exec, using the dma-buf implicit sync uAPI, have binds as "
"separate operations, and using the DRM scheduler to flow control the ring. "
"Let's deep dive on each of these."

"We can get away from a BO list by forcing the user to use in / out fences on "
"every exec rather than the kernel tracking dependencies of BO (e.g. if the "
"user knows an exec writes to a BO and reads from the BO in the next exec, it "
"is the user's responsibility to pass in / out fence between the two execs)."

"We do not allow a user to trigger a bind at exec time rather we have a VM "
"bind IOCTL which uses the same in / out fence interface as exec. In that "
"sense, a VM bind is basically the same operation as an exec from the user "
"perspective. e.g. If an exec depends on a VM bind use the in / out fence "
"interface (struct drm_xe_sync) to synchronize like syncing between two "
"dependent execs."

"Although a user cannot trigger a bind, we still have to rebind userptrs in "
"the VM that have been invalidated since the last exec, likewise we also have "
"to rebind BOs that have been evicted by the kernel. We schedule these "
"rebinds behind any pending kernel operations on any external BOs in VM or "
"any BOs private to the VM. This is accomplished by the rebinds waiting on "
"BOs DMA_RESV_USAGE_KERNEL slot (kernel ops) and kernel ops waiting on all "
"BOs slots (inflight execs are in the DMA_RESV_USAGE_BOOKKEEP for private BOs "
"and for external BOs)."

"There is no need to flow control the ring in the exec as we write the ring "

"MAX_JOB_SIZE. The DRM scheduler will then hold all jobs until space in the "
"ring is available."
