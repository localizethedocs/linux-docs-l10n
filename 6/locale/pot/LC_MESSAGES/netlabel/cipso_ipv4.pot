"The NetLabel CIPSO/IPv4 protocol engine is based on the IETF Commercial IP "
"Security Option (CIPSO) draft from July 16, 1992.  A copy of this draft can "
"be found in this directory (draft-ietf-cipso-ipsecurity-01.txt).  While the "
"IETF draft never made it to an RFC standard it has become a de-facto "
"standard for labeled networking and is used in many trusted operating "
"systems."

msgid ""
"The CIPSO/IPv4 protocol engine applies the CIPSO IP option to packets by "
"adding the CIPSO label to the socket.  This causes all packets leaving the "
"system through the socket to have the CIPSO IP option applied.  The socket's "
"CIPSO label can be changed at any point in time, however, it is recommended "
"that it is set upon the socket's creation.  The LSM can set the socket's "
"CIPSO label by using the NetLabel security module API; if the NetLabel "
"\"domain\" is configured to use CIPSO for packet labeling then a CIPSO IP "
"option will be generated and attached to the socket."

msgid ""
"The CIPSO/IPv4 protocol engine validates every CIPSO IP option it finds at "
"the IP layer without any special handling required by the LSM.  However, in "
"order to decode and translate the CIPSO label on the packet the LSM must use "
"the NetLabel security module API to extract the security attributes of the "
"packet. This is typically done at the socket layer using the "
"'socket_sock_rcv_skb()' LSM hook."

"The CIPSO/IPv4 protocol engine contains a mechanism to translate CIPSO "
"security attributes such as sensitivity level and category to values which "
"are appropriate for the host.  These mappings are defined as part of a CIPSO "
"Domain Of Interpretation (DOI) definition and are configured through the "
"NetLabel user space communication layer.  Each DOI definition can have a "
"different security attribute mapping table."
