"The High Precision Event Timer (HPET) hardware follows a specification by "
"Intel and Microsoft, revision 1."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../timers/hpet.rst:8
msgid ""
"Each HPET has one fixed-rate counter (at 10+ MHz, hence \"High Precision\") "
"and up to 32 comparators.  Normally three or more comparators are provided, "
"each of which can generate oneshot interrupts and at least one of which has "
"additional hardware to support periodic interrupts.  The comparators are "
"also called \"timers\", which can be misleading since usually timers are "
"independent of each other ... these share a counter, complicating resets."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../timers/hpet.rst:15
msgid ""
"HPET devices can support two interrupt routing modes.  In one mode, the "
"comparators are additional interrupt sources with no particular system "
"role.  Many x86 BIOS writers don't route HPET interrupts at all, which "
"prevents use of that mode.  They support the other \"legacy replacement\" "
"mode where the first two comparators block interrupts from 8254 timers and "
"from the RTC."

msgid ""
"The driver supports detection of HPET driver allocation and initialization "
"of the HPET before the driver module_init routine is called.  This enables "
"platform code which uses timer 0 or 1 as the main timer to intercept HPET "
"initialization.  An example of this initialization can be found in arch/x86/"
"kernel/hpet.c."

"The driver provides a userspace API which resembles the API found in the RTC "
"driver framework.  An example user space program is provided in file:samples/"
