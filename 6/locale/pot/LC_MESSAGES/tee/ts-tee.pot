"Trusted Services [1] is a TrustedFirmware.org project that provides a "
"framework for developing and deploying device Root of Trust services in FF-A "
"[2] S-EL0 Secure Partitions. The project hosts the reference implementation "
"of the Arm Platform Security Architecture [3] for Arm A-profile devices."

"The FF-A Secure Partitions (SP) are accessible through the FF-A driver [4] "
"which provides the low level communication for this driver. On top of that "
"the Trusted Services RPC protocol is used [5]. To use the driver from user "
"space a reference implementation is provided at [6], which is part of the "
"Trusted Services client library called libts [7]."

"All Trusted Services (TS) SPs have the same FF-A UUID; it identifies the TS "
"RPC protocol. A TS SP can host one or more services (e.g. PSA Crypto, PSA "
"ITS, etc). A service is identified by its service UUID; the same type of "
"service cannot be present twice in the same SP. During SP boot each service "
"in the SP is assigned an \"interface ID\". This is just a short ID to "
"simplify message addressing."

"The generic TEE design is to share memory at once with the Trusted OS, which "
"can then be reused to communicate with multiple applications running on the "
"Trusted OS. However, in case of FF-A, memory sharing works on an endpoint "
"level, i.e. memory is shared with a specific SP. User space has to be able "
"to separately share memory with each SP based on its endpoint ID; therefore "
"a separate TEE device is registered for each discovered TS SP. Opening the "
"SP corresponds to opening the TEE device and creating a TEE context. A TS SP "
"hosts one or more services. Opening a service corresponds to opening a "
"session in the given tee_context."
