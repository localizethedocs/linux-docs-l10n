"UART 1-Wire bus driver. The driver utilizes the UART interface via the "
"Serial Device Bus to create the 1-Wire timing patterns as described in the "
"document `\"Using a UART to Implement a 1-Wire Bus Master\"`_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../w1/masters/w1-uart.rst:19
msgid ""
"In short, the UART peripheral must support full-duplex and operate in open-"
"drain mode. The timing patterns are generated by a specific combination of "
"baud-rate and transmitted byte, which corresponds to a 1-Wire read bit, "
"write bit or reset pulse."

msgid ""
"For instance the timing pattern for a 1-Wire reset and presence detect uses "
"the baud-rate 9600, i.e. 104.2 us per bit. The transmitted byte 0xf0 over "
"UART (least significant bit first, start-bit low) sets the reset low time "
"for 1-Wire to 521 us. A present 1-Wire device changes the received byte by "
"pulling the line low, which is used by the driver to evaluate the result of "
"the 1-Wire operation."

"Similar for a 1-Wire read bit or write bit, which uses the baud-rate 115200, "
"i.e. 8.7 us per bit. The transmitted byte 0x80 is used for a Write-0 "
"operation (low time 69.6us) and the byte 0xff for Read-0, Read-1 and Write-1 "
"(low time 8.7us)."

#: ../../../w1/masters/w1-uart.rst:36
msgid ""
"The default baud-rate for reset and presence detection is 9600 and for a 1-"
"Wire read or write operation 115200. In case the actual baud-rate is "
"different from the requested one, the transmitted byte is adapted to "
"generate the 1-Wire timing patterns."
