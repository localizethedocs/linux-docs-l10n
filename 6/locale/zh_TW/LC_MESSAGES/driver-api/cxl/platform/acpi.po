"ACPI is the \"Advanced Configuration and Power Interface\", which is a "
"standard that defines how platforms and OS manage power and configure "
"computer hardware. For the purpose of this theory of operation, when "
"referring to \"ACPI\" we will usually refer to \"ACPI Tables\" - which are "
"the way a platform (BIOS/EFI) communicates static configuration information "
"to the operation system."
