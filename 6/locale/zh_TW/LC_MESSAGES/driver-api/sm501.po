"The Silicon Motion SM501 multimedia companion chip is a multifunction device "
"which may provide numerous interfaces including USB host controller USB "
"gadget, asynchronous serial ports, audio functions, and a dual display video "
"interface. The device may be connected by PCI or local bus with varying "
"functions enabled."

"The core driver in drivers/mfd provides common services for the drivers "

"On detection of a device, the core initialises the chip (which may be "
"specified by the platform data) and then exports the selected peripheral set "
"as platform devices for the specific drivers."

"The core re-uses the platform device system as the platform device system "

"The centralised memory allocation allows the driver to ensure that the "
"maximum possible resource allocation can be made to the video subsystem as "
"this is by-far the most resource-sensitive of the on-chip functions."

"The primary issue with memory allocation is that of moving the video buffers "
"once a display mode is chosen. Indeed when a video mode change occurs the "
"memory footprint of the video subsystem changes."

#: ../../../driver-api/sm501.rst:49
msgid ""
"Since video memory is difficult to move without changing the display (unless "
"sufficient contiguous memory can be provided for the old and new modes "
"simultaneously) the video driver fully utilises the memory area given to it "
"by aligning fb0 to the start of the area and fb1 to the end of it. Any "
"memory left over in the middle is used for the acceleration functions, which "
"are transient and thus their location is less critical as it can be moved."

"There is an errata (AB-5) affecting the selection of the of the M1XCLK and "
"M1CLK frequencies. These two clocks must be sourced from the same PLL, "
"although they can then be divided down individually. If this is not set, "
"then SM501 may lock and hang the whole system. The driver will refuse to "
"attach if the PLL selection is different."
