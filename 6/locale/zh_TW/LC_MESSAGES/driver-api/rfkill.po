"The rfkill subsystem provides a generic interface for disabling any radio "
"transmitter in the system. When a transmitter is blocked, it shall not "
"radiate any power."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/rfkill.rst:16
msgid ""
"The subsystem also provides the ability to react on button presses and "
"disable all transmitters of a certain type (or all). This is intended for "
"situations where transmitters need to be turned off, for example on aircraft."
msgstr ""

"The rfkill subsystem has a concept of \"hard\" and \"soft\" block, which "

#: ../../../driver-api/rfkill.rst:47
msgid ""
"The rfkill core provides API for kernel drivers to register their radio "
"transmitter with the kernel, methods for turning it on and off, and letting "
"the system know about hardware-disabled states that may be implemented on "
"the device."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/rfkill.rst:52
msgid ""
"The rfkill core code also notifies userspace of state changes, and provides "
"ways for userspace to query the current states. See the \"Userspace "
"support\" section below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/rfkill.rst:56
msgid ""
"When the device is hard-blocked (either by a call to rfkill_set_hw_state() "
"or from query_hw_block), set_block() will be invoked for additional software "
"block, but drivers can ignore the method call since they can use the return "
"value of the function rfkill_set_hw_state() to sync the software state "
"instead of keeping track of calls to set_block(). In fact, drivers should "
"use the return value of rfkill_set_hw_state() unless the hardware actually "
"keeps track of soft and hard block separately."

"Platform drivers might implement input devices if the rfkill button is just "
"that, a button. If that button influences the hardware then you need to "
"implement an rfkill driver instead. This also applies if the platform "
"provides a way to turn on/off the transmitter(s)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/rfkill.rst:75
msgid ""
"For some platforms, it is possible that the hardware state changes during "
"suspend/hibernation, in which case it will be necessary to update the rfkill "
"core with the current state at resume time."

msgid "To create an rfkill driver, driver's Kconfig needs to have::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/rfkill.rst:83
msgid ""
"to ensure the driver cannot be built-in when rfkill is modular. The !RFKILL "
"case allows the driver to be built when rfkill is not configured, in which "
"case all rfkill API can still be used but will be provided by static inlines "
"which compile to almost nothing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/rfkill.rst:88
msgid ""
"Calling rfkill_set_hw_state() when a state change happens is required from "
"rfkill drivers that control devices that can be hard-blocked unless they "
"also assign the poll_hw_block() callback (then the rfkill core will poll the "
"device). Don't do this unless you cannot get the event in any other way."

msgid "Userspace support"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The recommended userspace interface to use is /dev/rfkill, which is a misc "
"character device that allows userspace to obtain and set the state of rfkill "
"devices and sets of devices. It also notifies userspace about device "
"addition and removal. The API is a simple read/write API that is defined in "
"linux/rfkill.h, with one ioctl that allows turning off the deprecated input "
"handler in the kernel for the transition period."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/rfkill.rst:107
msgid ""
"Except for the one ioctl, communication with the kernel is done via read() "
"and write() of instances of 'struct rfkill_event'. In this structure, the "
"soft and hard block are properly separated (unlike sysfs, see below) and "
"userspace is able to get a consistent snapshot of all rfkill devices in the "
"system. Also, it is possible to switch all rfkill drivers (or all drivers of "
"a specified type) into a state which also updates the default state for "
"hotplugged devices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/rfkill.rst:115
msgid ""
"After an application opens /dev/rfkill, it can read the current state of all "
"devices. Changes can be obtained by either polling the descriptor for "
"hotplug or state change events or by listening for uevents emitted by the "
"rfkill core framework."
