"This framework is designed to provide a standard kernel interface to control "
"the settings of the interconnects on an SoC. These settings can be "
"throughput, latency and priority between multiple interconnected devices or "
"functional blocks. This can be controlled dynamically in order to save power "
"or provide maximum performance."

"The interconnect bus is hardware with configurable parameters, which can be "
"set on a data path according to the requests received from various drivers. "
"An example of interconnect buses are the interconnects between various "
"components or functional blocks in chipsets. There can be multiple "
"interconnects on an SoC that can be multi-tiered."
