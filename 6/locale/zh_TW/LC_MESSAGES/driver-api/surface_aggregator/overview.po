"The Surface/System Aggregator Module (SAM, SSAM) is an (arguably *the*) "
"embedded controller (EC) on Microsoft Surface devices. It has been "
"originally introduced on 4th generation devices (Surface Pro 4, Surface Book "
"1), but its responsibilities and feature-set have since been expanded "
"significantly with the following generations."

"Not much is currently known about SAM on 4th generation devices (Surface Pro "
"4, Surface Book 1), due to the use of a different communication interface "
"between host and EC (as detailed below). On 5th (Surface Pro 2017, Surface "
"Book 2, Surface Laptop 1) and later generation devices, SAM is responsible "
"for providing battery information (both current status and static values, "
"such as maximum capacity etc.), as well as an assortment of temperature "
"sensors (e.g. skin temperature) and cooling/performance-mode setting to the "
"host. On the Surface Book 2, specifically, it additionally provides an "
"interface for properly handling clipboard detachment (i.e. separating the "
"display part from the keyboard part of the device), on the Surface Laptop 1 "
"and 2 it is required for keyboard HID input. This HID subsystem has been "
"restructured for 7th generation devices and on those, specifically Surface "
"Laptop 3 and Surface Book 3, is responsible for all major HID input (i.e. "
"keyboard and touchpad)."

"While features have not changed much on a coarse level since the 5th "
"generation, internal interfaces have undergone some rather large changes. On "
"5th and 6th generation devices, both battery and temperature information is "
"exposed to ACPI via a shim driver (referred to as Surface ACPI Notify, or "
"SAN), translating ACPI generic serial bus write-/read-accesses to SAM "
"requests. On 7th generation devices, this additional layer is gone and these "
"devices require a driver hooking directly into the SAM interface. Equally, "
"on newer generations, less devices are declared in ACPI, making them a bit "
"harder to discover and requiring us to hard-code a sort of device registry. "
"Due to this, a SSAM bus and subsystem with client devices (:c:type:`struct "
"ssam_device <ssam_device>`) has been implemented."

msgid ""
"The type of communication interface between host and EC depends on the "
"generation of the Surface device. On 4th generation devices, host and EC "
"communicate via HID, specifically using a HID-over-I2C device, whereas on "
"5th and later generations, communication takes place via a USART serial "
"device. In accordance to the drivers found on other operating systems, we "
"refer to the serial device and its driver as Surface Serial Hub (SSH). When "
"needed, we differentiate between both types of SAM by referring to them as "
"SAM-over-SSH and SAM-over-HID."

"Currently, this subsystem only supports SAM-over-SSH. The SSH communication "
"interface is described in more detail below. The HID interface has not been "
"reverse engineered yet and it is, at the moment, unclear how many (and "
"which) concepts of the SSH interface detailed below can be transferred to it."

"As already elaborated above, the Surface Serial Hub (SSH) is the "
"communication interface for SAM on 5th- and all later-generation Surface "
"devices. On the highest level, communication can be separated into two main "
"types: Requests, messages sent from host to EC that may trigger a direct "
"response from the EC (explicitly associated with the request), and events "
"(sometimes also referred to as notifications), sent from EC to host without "
"being a direct response to a previous request. We may also refer to requests "
"without response as commands. In general, events need to be enabled via one "
"of multiple dedicated requests before they are sent by the EC."
