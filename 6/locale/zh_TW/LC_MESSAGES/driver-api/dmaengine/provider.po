"operations."

"They have a given number of channels to use for the DMA transfers, and a "
"given number of requests lines."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:14
msgid ""
"Requests and channels are pretty much orthogonal. Channels can be used to "
"serve several to any requests. To simplify, channels are the entities that "
"will be doing the copy, and requests what endpoints are involved."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:19
msgid ""
"The request lines actually correspond to physical lines going from the DMA-"
"eligible devices to the controller itself. Whenever the device will want to "
"start a transfer, it will assert a DMA request (DRQ) by asserting that "
"request line."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:24
msgid ""
"A very simple DMA controller would only take into account a single "
"parameter: the transfer size. At each clock cycle, it would transfer a byte "
"of data from one buffer to another, until the transfer size has been reached."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:29
msgid ""
"That wouldn't work well in the real world, since slave devices might require "
"a specific number of bits to be transferred in a single cycle. For example, "
"we may want to transfer as much data as the physical bus allows to maximize "
"performances when doing a simple memory copy operation, but our audio device "
"could have a narrower FIFO that requires data to be written exactly 16 or 24 "
"bits at a time. This is why most if not all of the DMA controllers can "
"adjust this, using a parameter called the transfer width."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:38
msgid ""
"Moreover, some DMA controllers, whenever the RAM is used as a source or "
"destination, can group the reads or writes in memory into a buffer, so "
"instead of having a lot of small memory accesses, which is not really "
"efficient, you'll get several bigger transfers. This is done using a "
"parameter called the burst size, that defines how many single reads/writes "
"it's allowed to do without the controller splitting the transfer into "
"smaller sub-transfers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:46
msgid ""
"Our theoretical DMA controller would then only be able to do transfers that "
"involve a single contiguous block of data. However, some of the transfers we "
"usually have are not, and want to copy data from non-contiguous buffers to a "
"contiguous buffer, which is called scatter-gather."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:52
msgid ""
"DMAEngine, at least for mem2dev transfers, require support for scatter-"
"gather. So we're left with two cases here: either we have a quite simple DMA "
"controller that doesn't support it, and we'll have to implement it in "
"software, or we have a more advanced DMA controller, that implements in "
"hardware scatter-gather."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:58
msgid ""
"The latter are usually programmed using a collection of chunks to transfer, "
"and whenever the transfer is started, the controller will go over that "
"collection, doing whatever we programmed there."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:62
msgid ""
"This collection is usually either a table or a linked list. You will then "
"push either the address of the table and its number of elements, or the "
"first item of the list to one channel of the DMA controller, and whenever a "
"DRQ will be asserted, it will go through the collection to know where to "
"fetch the data from."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:68
msgid ""
"Either way, the format of this collection is completely dependent on your "
"hardware. Each DMA controller will require a different structure, but all of "
"them will require, for every chunk, at least the source and destination "
"addresses, whether it should increment these addresses or not and the three "
"parameters we saw earlier: the burst size, the transfer width and the "
"transfer size."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../driver-api/dmaengine/provider.rst:75
msgid ""
"The one last thing is that usually, slave devices won't issue DRQ by "
"default, and you have to enable this in your slave device driver first "
"whenever you're willing to use DMA."

"These were just the general memory-to-memory (also called mem2mem) or memory-"
