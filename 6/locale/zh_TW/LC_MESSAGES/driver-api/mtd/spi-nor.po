"Most SPI NOR flashes comply with the JEDEC JESD216 Serial Flash Discoverable "
"Parameter (SFDP) standard. SFDP describes the functional and feature "
"capabilities of serial flash devices in a standard set of internal read-only "
"parameter tables."

"The SPI NOR driver queries the SFDP tables in order to determine the flash's "
"parameters and settings. If the flash defines the SFDP tables it's likely "
"that you won't need a flash entry at all, and instead rely on the generic "
"flash driver which probes the flash solely based on its SFDP data. All one "
"has to do is to specify the \"jedec,spi-nor\" compatible in the device tree."

"There are cases however where you need to define an explicit flash entry. "
"This typically happens when the flash has settings or support that is not "
"covered by the SFDP tables (e.g. Block Protection), or when the flash "
"contains mangled SFDP data. If the later, one needs to implement the "
"``spi_nor_fixups`` hooks in order to amend the SFDP parameters with the "
"correct values."
