"The io_mapping functions in linux/io-mapping.h provide an abstraction for "
"efficiently mapping small regions of an I/O device to the CPU. The initial "
"usage is to support the large graphics aperture on 32-bit processors where "
"ioremap_wc cannot be used to statically map the entire aperture to the CPU "
"as it would consume too much of the kernel address space."

"'offset' is the offset within the defined mapping region.  Accessing "
