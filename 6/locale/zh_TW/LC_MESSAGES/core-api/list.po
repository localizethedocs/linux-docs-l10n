"Please note that while linked lists certainly are ubiquitous, they are "
"rarely the best data structure to use in cases where a simple array doesn't "
"already suffice. In particular, due to their poor data locality, linked "
"lists are a bad choice in situations where performance may be of "
"consideration. Familiarizing oneself with other in-kernel generic data "
"structures, especially for concurrent accesses, is highly encouraged."

"The Linux kernel's doubly-linked list is circular in nature. This means that "

#: ../../../core-api/list.rst:55
msgid ""
"This may be an unfamiliar approach to some, as the classical explanation of "
"a linked list is a list node data structure with pointers to the previous "
"and next list node, as well the payload data. Linux chooses this approach "
"because it allows for generic list modification code regardless of what data "
"structure is contained within the list. Since the struct list_head member is "
"not a pointer but part of the data structure proper, the container_of() "
"pattern can be used by the list implementation to access the payload data "
"regardless of its type, while staying oblivious to what said type actually "
