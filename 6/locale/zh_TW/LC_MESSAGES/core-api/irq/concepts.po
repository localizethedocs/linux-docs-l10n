"An IRQ is an interrupt request from a device. Currently, they can come in "
"over a pin, or over a packet. Several devices may be connected to the same "
"pin thus sharing an IRQ. Such as on legacy PCI bus: All devices typically "
"share 4 lanes/pins. Note that each device can request an interrupt on each "
"of the lanes."

"An IRQ number is a kernel identifier used to talk about a hardware interrupt "
"source. Typically, this is an index into the global irq_desc array or "
"sparse_irqs tree. But except for what linux/interrupt.h implements, the "
"details are architecture specific."

msgid ""
"An IRQ number is an enumeration of the possible interrupt sources on a "
"machine. Typically, what is enumerated is the number of input pins on all of "
"the interrupt controllers in the system. In the case of ISA, what is "
"enumerated are the 8 input pins on each of the two i8259 interrupt "
"controllers."

"Architectures can assign additional meaning to the IRQ numbers, and are "
"encouraged to in the case where there is any manual configuration of the "
"hardware involved. The ISA IRQs are a classic example of assigning this kind "
"of additional meaning."
