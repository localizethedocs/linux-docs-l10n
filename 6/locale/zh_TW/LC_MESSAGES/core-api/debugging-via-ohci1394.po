"Basically all FireWire controllers which are in use today are compliant to "
"the OHCI-1394 specification which defines the controller to be a PCI bus "
"master which uses DMA to offload data transfers from the CPU and has a "
"\"Physical Response Unit\" which executes specific requests by employing PCI-"
"Bus master DMA after applying filters defined by the OHCI-1394 driver."

"Once properly configured, remote machines can send these requests to ask the "
"OHCI-1394 controller to perform read and write requests on physical system "
"memory and, for read requests, send the result of the physical memory read "
"back to the requester."

"With most FireWire controllers, memory access is limited to the low 4 GB of "
"physical address space.  This can be a problem on machines where memory is "
"located mostly above that limit, but it is rarely a problem on more common "
"hardware such as x86, x86-64 and PowerPC."

"Together with a early initialization of the OHCI-1394 controller for "
