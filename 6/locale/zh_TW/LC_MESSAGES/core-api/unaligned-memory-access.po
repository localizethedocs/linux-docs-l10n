"Linux runs on a wide variety of architectures which have varying behaviour "

"unaligned accesses, why you need to write code that doesn't cause them, and "

"Unaligned memory accesses occur when you try to read N bytes of data "
"starting from an address that is not evenly divisible by N (i.e. addr % N != "
"0). For example, reading 4 bytes of data from address 0x10004 is fine, but "
"reading 4 bytes of data from address 0x10005 would be an unaligned memory "
"access."

"The above may seem a little vague, as memory access can happen in different "
"ways. The context here is at the machine code level: certain instructions "
"read or write a number of bytes to or from memory (e.g. movb, movw, movl in "
"x86 assembly). As will become clear, it is relatively easy to spot C "
"statements which will compile to multiple-byte memory access instructions, "
"namely when dealing with types such as u16, u32 and u64."

"Some architectures are not capable of unaligned memory access, but will "

"It should be obvious from the above that if your code causes unaligned "

"At first, the concepts above may seem a little hard to relate to actual "

"Fortunately things are not too complex, as in most cases, the compiler "
"ensures that things will work for you. For example, take the following "
"structure::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst:93
msgid ""
"Let us assume that an instance of the above structure resides in memory "
"starting at address 0x10000. With a basic level of understanding, it would "
"not be unreasonable to expect that accessing field2 would cause an unaligned "
"access. You'd be expecting field2 to be located at offset 2 bytes into the "
"structure, i.e. address 0x10002, but that address is not evenly divisible by "
"4 (remember, we're reading a 4 byte value here)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst:100
msgid ""
"Fortunately, the compiler understands the alignment constraints, so in the "
"above case it would insert 2 bytes of padding in between field1 and field2. "
"Therefore, for standard structure types you can always rely on the compiler "
"to pad structures so that accesses to fields are suitably aligned (assuming "
"you do not cast the field to a type of different length)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst:106
msgid ""
"Similarly, you can also rely on the compiler to align variables and function "
"parameters to a naturally aligned scheme, based on the size of the type of "
"the variable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst:110
msgid ""
"At this point, it should be clear that accessing a single byte (u8 or char) "
"will never cause an unaligned access, because all memory addresses are "
"evenly divisible by one."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst:114
msgid ""
"On a related topic, with the above considerations in mind you may observe "
"that you could reorder the fields in the structure in order to place fields "
"where padding would otherwise be inserted, and hence reduce the overall "
"resident memory size of structure instances. The optimal layout of the above "
"example is::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst:126
msgid ""
"For a natural alignment scheme, the compiler would only have to add a single "
"byte of padding at the end of the structure. This padding is added in order "
"to satisfy alignment constraints for arrays of these structures."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst:130
msgid ""
"Another point worth mentioning is the use of __attribute__((packed)) on a "
"structure type. This GCC-specific attribute tells the compiler never to "
"insert any padding within structures, useful when you want to use a C struct "
"to represent some data that comes in a fixed arrangement 'off the wire'."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../core-api/unaligned-memory-access.rst:135
msgid ""
"You might be inclined to believe that usage of this attribute can easily "
"lead to unaligned accesses when accessing fields that do not satisfy "
"architectural alignment requirements. However, again, the compiler is aware "
"of the alignment constraints and will generate extra instructions to perform "
"the memory access in a way that does not cause unaligned access. Of course, "
"the extra instructions obviously cause a loss in performance compared to the "
"non-packed case, so the packed attribute should only be used when avoiding "
"structure padding is of importance."

"With the above in mind, let's move onto a real life example of a function "

"include/linux/etherdevice.h is an optimized routine to compare two ethernet "
"MAC addresses for equality::"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the above function, when the hardware has efficient unaligned access "
"capability, there is no issue with this code.  But when the hardware isn't "
"able to access memory on arbitrary boundaries, the reference to a[0] causes "
"2 bytes (16 bits) to be read from memory starting at address addr1."

"Despite the potential unaligned access problems with the above function, it "

"These macros work for memory accesses of any length (not just 32 bits as in "
