"Credits go to Johannes Berg for reverse-engineering the touchpad protocol, "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../input/devices/appletouch.rst:27
msgid ""
"In order to use the touchpad in the basic mode, compile the driver and load "
"the module. A new input device will be detected and you will be able to read "
"the mouse data from /dev/input/mice (using gpm, or X11)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../input/devices/appletouch.rst:31
msgid ""
"In X11, you can configure the touchpad to use the synaptics X11 driver, "
"which will give additional functionalities, like acceleration, scrolling, 2 "
"finger tap for middle button mouse emulation, 3 finger tap for right button "
"mouse emulation, etc. In order to do this, make sure you're using a recent "
"version of the synaptics driver (tested with 0.14.2, available from [#f2]_), "
"and configure a new input device in your X11 configuration file (take a look "
"below for an example). For additional configuration, see the synaptics "
"driver documentation::"

"The touchpad sensors are very sensitive to heat, and will generate a lot of "
"noise when the temperature changes. This is especially true when you power-"
"on the laptop for the first time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../input/devices/appletouch.rst:75
msgid ""
"The appletouch driver tries to handle this noise and auto adapt itself, but "
"it is not perfect. If finger movements are not recognized anymore, try "
"reloading the driver."
