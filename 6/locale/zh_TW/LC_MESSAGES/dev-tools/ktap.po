msgid ""
"TAP, or the Test Anything Protocol is a format for specifying test results "
"used by a number of projects. It's website and specification are found at "
"this `link <https://testanything.org/>`_. The Linux Kernel largely uses TAP "
"output for test results. However, Kernel testing frameworks have special "
"needs for test results which don't align with the original TAP "
"specification. Thus, a \"Kernel TAP\" (KTAP) format is specified to extend "
"and alter TAP to support these use-cases. This specification describes the "
"generally accepted format of KTAP as it is currently used in the kernel."

"KTAP test results describe a series of tests (which may be nested: i.e., "
"test can have subtests), each of which can contain both diagnostic data -- e."
"g., log lines -- and a final result. The test structure and results are "
"machine-readable, whereas the diagnostic data is unstructured and is there "
"to aid human debugging."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../dev-tools/ktap.rst:22

"KTAP output is built from four different types of lines: - Version lines - "
"Plan lines - Test case result lines - Diagnostic lines"

"In general, valid KTAP output should also form valid TAP output, but some "
"information, in particular nested test results, may be lost. Also note that "
"there is a stagnant draft specification for TAP14, KTAP diverges from this "
"in a couple of places (notably the \"Subtest\" header), which are described "
"where relevant later in this document."
