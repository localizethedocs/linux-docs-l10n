"Post Package Repair is a maintenance operation which requests the memory "

"Memory sparing is a repair function that replaces a portion of memory with a "
"portion of functional memory at a particular granularity. Memory sparing has "
"cacheline/row/bank/rank sparing granularities. For example, in rank memory-"
"sparing mode, one memory rank serves as a spare for other ranks on the same "
"channel in case they fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../edac/memory_repair.rst:59

"After an error threshold is surpassed in a system protected by memory "
"sparing, the content of a failing rank of DIMMs is copied to the spare rank. "

"Cacheline sparing subclass refers to a sparing action that can replace a "

"When a CXL device detects an error in a memory component, it informs the "

"repair. The kernel reports the corresponding CXL general media or DRAM trace "
"event to userspace, and userspace tools (e.g. rasdaemon) initiate a repair "

"repair control."
