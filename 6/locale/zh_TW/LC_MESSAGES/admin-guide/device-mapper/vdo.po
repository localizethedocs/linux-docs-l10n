"The dm-vdo (virtual data optimizer) device mapper target provides block-"
"level deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning. As a device mapper "
"target, it can add these features to the storage stack, compatible with any "
"file system. The vdo target does not protect against data corruption, "
"relying instead on integrity protection of the storage below it. It is "
"strongly recommended that lvm be used to manage vdo volumes. See lvmvdo(7)."
