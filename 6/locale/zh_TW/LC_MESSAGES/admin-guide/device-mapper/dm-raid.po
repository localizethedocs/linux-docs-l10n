"The implementation of discard support among hardware vendors varies. When a "

"devices will return random data.  Confusingly, some devices that advertise "

"are read!  Since RAID 4/5/6 uses blocks from a number of devices to "

"'discard_zeroes_data' being reliable, it is important that the devices be "
"consistent.  Blocks may be discarded in the middle of a RAID 4/5/6 stripe "
"and if subsequent read results are not consistent, the parity blocks may be "
"calculated differently at any time; making the parity blocks useless for "
"redundancy.  It is important to understand how your hardware behaves with "
