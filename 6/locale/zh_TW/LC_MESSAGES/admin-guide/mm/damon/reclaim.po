"DAMON-based Reclamation (DAMON_RECLAIM) is a static kernel module that aimed "
"to be used for proactive and lightweight reclamation under light memory "
"pressure. It doesn't aim to replace the LRU-list based page_granularity "
"reclamation, but to be selectively used for different level of memory "
"pressure and requirements."

"Free Pages Reporting [3]_ based memory over-commit virtualization systems "
"are good example of the cases.  In such systems, the guest VMs reports their "
"free memory to host, and the host reallocates the reported memory to other "
"guests. As a result, the memory of the systems are fully utilized.  However, "
"the guests could be not so memory-frugal, mainly because some kernel "
"subsystems and user-space applications are designed to use as much memory as "
"available.  Then, guests could report only small amount of memory as free to "
"host, results in memory utilization drop of the systems.  Running the "
"proactive reclamation in guests could mitigate this problem."
