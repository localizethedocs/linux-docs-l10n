"DAMON-based LRU-lists Sorting (DAMON_LRU_SORT) is a static kernel module "
"that aimed to be used for proactive and lightweight data access pattern "
"based (de)prioritization of pages on their LRU-lists for making LRU-lists a "
"more trusworthy data access pattern source."

msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/mm/damon/lru_sort.rst:15
msgid ""
"As page-granularity access checking overhead could be significant on huge "
"systems, LRU lists are normally not proactively sorted but partially and "
"reactively sorted for special events including specific user requests, "
"system calls and memory pressure.  As a result, LRU lists are sometimes not "
"so perfectly prepared to be used as a trustworthy access pattern source for "
"some situations including reclamation target pages selection under sudden "
"memory pressure."

"Because DAMON can identify access patterns of best-effort accuracy while "
"inducing only user-specified range of overhead, proactively running "
"DAMON_LRU_SORT could be helpful for making LRU lists more trustworthy access "

msgid ""
"DAMON_LRU_SORT finds hot pages (pages of memory regions that showing access "
"rates that higher than a user-specified threshold) and cold pages (pages of "
"memory regions that showing no access for a time that longer than a user-"
"specified threshold) using DAMON, and prioritizes hot pages while "
"deprioritizing cold pages on their LRU-lists.  To avoid it consuming too "
"much CPU for the prioritizations, a CPU time usage limit can be configured.  "
"Under the limit, it prioritizes and deprioritizes more hot and cold pages "
"first, respectively.  System administrators can also configure under what "
"situation this scheme should automatically activated and deactivated with "
"three memory pressure watermarks."

"Its default parameters for hotness/coldness thresholds and CPU quota limit "

"memory pressure while consuming only a limited small portion of CPU time."
