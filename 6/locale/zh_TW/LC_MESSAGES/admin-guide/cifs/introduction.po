"This is the client VFS module for the SMB3 NAS protocol as well as for older "
"dialects such as the Common Internet File System (CIFS) protocol which was "
"the successor to the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol, the native file "
"sharing mechanism for most early PC operating systems. New and improved "
"versions of CIFS are now called SMB2 and SMB3. Use of SMB3 (and later, "
"including SMB3.1.1 the most current dialect) is strongly preferred over "
"using older dialects like CIFS due to security reasons. All modern dialects, "
"including the most recent, SMB3.1.1, are supported by the CIFS VFS module. "
"The SMB3 protocol is implemented and supported by all major file servers "
"such as Windows (including Windows 2019 Server), as well as by Samba (which "
"provides excellent CIFS/SMB2/SMB3 server support and tools for Linux and "
"many other operating systems). Apple systems also support SMB3 well, as do "
"most Network Attached Storage vendors, so this network filesystem client can "
"mount to a wide variety of systems. It also supports mounting to the cloud "
"(for example Microsoft Azure), including the necessary security features."

"The intent of this module is to provide the most advanced network file "
"system function for SMB3 compliant servers, including advanced security "
"features, excellent parallelized high performance i/o, better POSIX "
"compliance, secure per-user session establishment, encryption, high "
"performance safe distributed caching (leases/oplocks), optional packet "
"signing, large files, Unicode support and other internationalization "
"improvements. Since both Samba server and this filesystem client support the "
"CIFS Unix extensions, and the Linux client also supports SMB3 POSIX "
"extensions, the combination can provide a reasonable alternative to other "
"network and cluster file systems for fileserving in some Linux to Linux "
"environments, not just in Linux to Windows (or Linux to Mac) environments."
