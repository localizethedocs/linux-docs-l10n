"The  RF  Tuner  Input  is the input to the tuner module of the card.  The  "
"Tuner  is  otherwise known as the \"Frontend\" . The Frontend of the "
"Avermedia DVB-T is a Microtune 7202D. A timely post  to  the  linux-dvb  "
"mailing  list  ascertained  that the Microtune  7202D  is  supported  by the "
"sp887x driver which is found in the dvb-hw CVS module."

"multimedia bridge and often found on Analogue TV cards. There is no on-board "
"MPEG2 decoder, which means that all MPEG2 decoding  must  be done in "
"software, or if you have one, on an MPEG2 hardware decoding card or chipset."

"At  this  stage,  it  has  not  been  able  to  ascertain  the "

"DVBT.  However,  full  functionality  in respect of tuning,  receiving  and  "
"supplying  the  MPEG2  data stream is possible  with the currently available "
"versions of the driver. It  may be possible that additional functionality is "
"available from  the  card  (i.e.  viewing the additional analogue inputs "
"that  the card presents), but this has not been tested yet. If I get around "
"to this, I'll update the document with whatever I find."

"dvbstream  and  VideoLAN  Client on windows works a treat with DVB,  in  "
