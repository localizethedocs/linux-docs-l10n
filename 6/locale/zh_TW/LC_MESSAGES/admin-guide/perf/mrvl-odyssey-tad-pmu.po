"Each TAD provides eight 64-bit counters for monitoring cache behavior.The "
"driver always configures the same counter for all the TADs. The user would "
"end up effectively reserving one of eight counters in every TAD to look "
"across all TADs. The occurrences of events are aggregated and presented to "
"the user at the end of running the workload. The driver does not provide a "
"way for the user to partition TADs so that different TADs are used for "
"different applications."

"The performance events reflect various internal or interface activities. By "
"combining the values from multiple performance counters, cache performance "
"can be measured in terms such as: cache miss rate, cache allocations, "
"interface retry rate, internal resource occupancy, etc."
