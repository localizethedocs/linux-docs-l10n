"The PMUs in this document are based on ARM CoreSight PMU Architecture as "

"the PMUs are managed by a common driver \"arm-cs-arch-pmu\". This driver "
"describes the available events and configuration of each PMU in sysfs. "
"Please see the sections below to get the sysfs path of each PMU. Like other "
"uncore PMU drivers, the driver provides \"cpumask\" sysfs attribute to show "
"the CPU id used to handle the PMU event. There is also \"associated_cpus\" "
