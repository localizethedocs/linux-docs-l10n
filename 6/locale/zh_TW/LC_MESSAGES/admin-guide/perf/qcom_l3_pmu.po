"This driver supports the L3 cache PMUs found in Qualcomm Datacenter "
"Technologies Centriq SoCs. The L3 cache on these SOCs is composed of "
"multiple slices, shared by all cores within a socket. Each slice is exposed "
"as a separate uncore perf PMU with device name l3cache_<socket>_<instance>. "
"User space is responsible for aggregating across slices."

"The driver provides a description of its available events and configuration "
"options in sysfs, see /sys/bus/event_source/devices/l3cache*. Given that "
"these are uncore PMUs the driver also exposes a \"cpumask\" sysfs attribute "
"which contains a mask consisting of one CPU per socket which will be used to "
"handle all the PMU events on that socket."

"The hardware implements 32bit event counters and has a flat 8bit event space "
"exposed via the \"event\" format attribute. In addition to the 32bit "
"physical counters the driver supports virtual 64bit hardware counters by "
"using hardware counter chaining. This feature is exposed via the "
"\"lc\" (long counter) format flag. E.g.::"

"Given that these are uncore PMUs the driver does not support sampling, "
"therefore \"perf record\" will not work. Per-task perf sessions are not "
"supported."
