"When comparing performance with other filesystems, it's always important to "
"try multiple workloads; very often a subtle change in a workload parameter "
"can completely change the ranking of which filesystems do well compared to "
"others.  When comparing versus ext3, note that ext4 enables write barriers "
"by default, while ext3 does not enable write barriers by default.  So it is "
"useful to use explicitly specify whether barriers are enabled or not when "
"via the '-o barriers=[0|1]' mount option for both ext3 and ext4 filesystems "
"for a fair comparison.  When tuning ext3 for best benchmark numbers, it is "
"often worthwhile to try changing the data journaling mode; '-o "
"data=writeback' can be faster for some workloads.  (Note however that "
"running mounted with data=writeback can potentially leave stale data exposed "
"in recently written files in case of an unclean shutdown, which could be a "
"security exposure in some situations.)  Configuring the filesystem with a "

"The case-insensitive file name lookup feature is supported on a per-"

"sensitive directories in the same filesystem.  It is enabled by flipping the "
"+F inode attribute of an empty directory.  The case-insensitive string match "
"operation is only defined when we know how text in encoded in a byte "
"sequence.  For that reason, in order to enable case-insensitive directories, "
"the filesystem must have the casefold feature, which stores the filesystem-"
"wide encoding model used.  By default, the charset adopted is the latest "
"version of Unicode (12.1.0, by the time of this writing), encoded in the "
"UTF-8 form.  The comparison algorithm is implemented by normalizing the "
"strings to the Canonical decomposition form, as defined by Unicode, followed "

"The case-awareness is name-preserving on the disk, meaning that the file "

"thus an internal representation, and not exposed to the userspace nor to the "
"disk, with the important exception of disk hashes, used on large case-"
"insensitive directories with DX feature.  On DX directories, the hash must "

"When we change from viewing filenames as opaque byte sequences to seeing "

"kernel leaves the decision of what to do in this case to the filesystem, "
"which select its preferred behavior by enabling/disabling the strict mode.  "
"When Ext4 encounters one of those strings and the filesystem did not require "
"strict mode, it falls back to considering the entire string as an opaque "
"byte sequence, which still allows the user to operate on that file, but the "
"case-insensitive lookups won't work."
