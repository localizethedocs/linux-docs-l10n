"The process number controller is used to allow a cgroup hierarchy to stop "
"any new tasks from being fork()'d or clone()'d after a certain limit is "
"reached."

"Since it is trivial to hit the task limit without hitting any kmemcg limits "
"in place, PIDs are a fundamental resource. As such, PID exhaustion must be "
"preventable in the scope of a cgroup hierarchy by allowing resource limiting "
"of the number of tasks in a cgroup."

#: ../../../admin-guide/cgroup-v1/pids.rst:19
msgid ""
"In order to use the `pids` controller, set the maximum number of tasks in "
"pids.max (this is not available in the root cgroup for obvious reasons). The "
"number of processes currently in the cgroup is given by pids.current."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cgroup-v1/pids.rst:23
msgid ""
"Organisational operations are not blocked by cgroup policies, so it is "
"possible to have pids.current > pids.max. This can be done by either setting "
"the limit to be smaller than pids.current, or attaching enough processes to "
"the cgroup such that pids.current > pids.max. However, it is not possible to "
"violate a cgroup policy through fork() or clone(). fork() and clone() will "
"return -EAGAIN if the creation of a new process would cause a cgroup policy "
"to be violated."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../admin-guide/cgroup-v1/pids.rst:30
msgid ""
"To set a cgroup to have no limit, set pids.max to \"max\". This is the "
"default for all new cgroups (N.B. that PID limits are hierarchical, so the "
"most stringent limit in the hierarchy is followed)."
