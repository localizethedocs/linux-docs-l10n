"During the lifetime of a GFS2 mount, a number of uevents are generated. This "
"document explains what the events are and what they are used for (by "
"gfs_controld in gfs2-utils)."

msgid "1. ADD"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/gfs2-uevents.rst:17
msgid ""
"The ADD event occurs at mount time. It will always be the first uevent "
"generated by the newly created filesystem. If the mount is successful, an "
"ONLINE uevent will follow.  If it is not successful then a REMOVE uevent "
"will follow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/gfs2-uevents.rst:22
msgid ""
"The ADD uevent has two environment variables: SPECTATOR=[0|1] and RDONLY=[0|"
"1] that specify the spectator status (a read-only mount with no journal "
"assigned), and read-only (with journal assigned) status of the filesystem "
"respectively."

msgid "2. ONLINE"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/gfs2-uevents.rst:30
msgid ""
"The ONLINE uevent is generated after a successful mount or remount. It has "
"the same environment variables as the ADD uevent. The ONLINE uevent, along "
"with the two environment variables for spectator and RDONLY are a relatively "
"recent addition (2.6.32-rc+) and will not be generated by older kernels."

msgid "3. CHANGE"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/gfs2-uevents.rst:39
msgid ""
"The CHANGE uevent is used in two places. One is when reporting the "
"successful mount of the filesystem by the first node (FIRSTMOUNT=Done). This "
"is used as a signal by gfs_controld that it is then ok for other nodes in "
"the cluster to mount the filesystem."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/gfs2-uevents.rst:44
msgid ""
"The other CHANGE uevent is used to inform of the completion of journal "
"recovery for one of the filesystems journals. It has two environment "
"variables, JID= which specifies the journal id which has just been "
"recovered, and RECOVERY=[Done|Failed] to indicate the success (or otherwise) "
"of the operation. These uevents are generated for every journal recovered, "
"whether it is during the initial mount process or as the result of "
"gfs_controld requesting a specific journal recovery via the /sys/fs/gfs2/"
"<fsname>/lock_module/recovery file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../filesystems/gfs2-uevents.rst:53
msgid ""
"Because the CHANGE uevent was used (in early versions of gfs_controld) "
"without checking the environment variables to discover the state, we cannot "
"add any more functions to it without running the risk of someone using an "
"older version of the user tools and breaking their cluster. For this reason "
"the ONLINE uevent was used when adding a new uevent for a successful mount "
"or remount."

"The OFFLINE uevent is only generated due to filesystem errors and is used as "

"information about what the error is, which is something that needs to be "

"The REMOVE uevent is generated at the end of an unsuccessful mount or at the "
"end of a umount of the filesystem. All REMOVE uevents will have been "
"preceded by at least an ADD uevent for the same filesystem, and unlike the "
"other uevents is generated automatically by the kernel's kobject subsystem."
