"OMFS is a filesystem created by SonicBlue for use in the ReplayTV DVR and "
"Rio Karma MP3 player.  The filesystem is extent-based, utilizing block sizes "
"from 2k to 8k, with hash-based directories.  This filesystem driver may be "
"used to read and write disks from these devices."

"Note, it is not recommended that this FS be used in place of a general "
"filesystem for your own streaming media device.  Native Linux filesystems "
"will likely perform better."

"OMFS discriminates between \"sysblocks\" and normal data blocks.  The "
"sysblock group consists of super block information, file metadata, directory "
"structures, and extents.  Each sysblock has a header containing CRCs of the "
"entire sysblock, and may be mirrored in successive blocks on the disk.  A "
"sysblock may have a smaller size than a data block, but since they are both "
"addressed by the same 64-bit block number, any remaining space in the "
"smaller sysblock is unused."
