"The efivarfs filesystem was created to address the shortcomings of using "
"entries in sysfs to maintain EFI variables. The old sysfs EFI variables code "
"only supported variables of up to 1024 bytes. This limitation existed in "
"version 0.99 of the EFI specification, but was removed before any full "
"releases. Since variables can now be larger than a single page, sysfs isn't "
"the best interface for this."

"Due to the presence of numerous firmware bugs where removing non-standard "

"that are not well-known standardized variables are created as immutable "
"files.  This doesn't prevent removal - \"chattr -i\" will work - but it does "
