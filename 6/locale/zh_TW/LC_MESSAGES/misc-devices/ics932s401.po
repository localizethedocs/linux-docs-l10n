"This chip has 4 clock outputs--a base clock for the CPU (which is likely "
"multiplied to get the real CPU clock), a system clock, a PCI clock, a USB "
"clock, and a reference clock.  The driver reports selected and actual "
"frequency.  If spread spectrum mode is enabled, the driver also reports by "
"what percent the clock signal is being spread, which should be between 0 and "
"-0.5%. All frequencies are reported in KHz."
