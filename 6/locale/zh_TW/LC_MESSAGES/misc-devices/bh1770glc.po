"BH1770GLC and SFH7770 are combined ambient light and proximity sensors. ALS "
"and proximity parts operates on their own, but they shares common I2C "
"interface and interrupt logic. In principle they can run on their own, but "
"ALS side results are used to estimate reliability of the proximity sensor."

"ALS produces 16 bit lux values. The chip contains interrupt logic to produce "
"low and high threshold interrupts."

msgid ""
"Proximity part contains IR-led driver up to 3 IR leds. The chip measures "
"amount of reflected IR light and produces proximity result. Resolution is 8 "
"bit. Driver supports only one channel. Driver uses ALS results to estimate "
"reliability of the proximity results. Thus ALS is always running while "
"proximity detection is needed."

"Driver uses threshold interrupts to avoid need for polling the values. "
"Proximity low interrupt doesn't exists in the chip. This is simulated by "
"using a delayed work. As long as there is proximity threshold above "
"interrupts the delayed work is pushed forward. So, when proximity level goes "
"below the threshold value, there is no interrupt and the delayed work will "
"finally run. This is handled as no proximity indication."

"calibrated source of light is needed as a reference. Calibscale factor is "
