"Fprobe is a function entry/exit probe based on the function-graph tracing "
"feature in ftrace. Instead of tracing all functions, if you want to attach "
"callbacks on specific function entry and exit, similar to the kprobes and "
"kretprobes, you can use fprobe. Compared with kprobes and kretprobes, fprobe "
"gives faster instrumentation for multiple functions with single handler. "
"This document describes how to use fprobe."
