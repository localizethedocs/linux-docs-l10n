"Associativity represents the groupings of the various platform resources "
"into domains of substantially similar mean performance relative to resources "
"outside of that domain. Resources subsets of a given domain that exhibit "
"better performance relative to each other than relative to other resources "
"subsets are represented as being members of a sub-grouping domain. This "
"performance characteristic is presented in terms of NUMA node distance "
"within the Linux kernel. From the platform view, these groups are also "
"referred to as domains."

"PAPR interface currently supports different ways of communicating these "
