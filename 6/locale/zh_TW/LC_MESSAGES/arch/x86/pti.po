"Page Table Isolation (pti, previously known as KAISER [1]_) is a "
"countermeasure against attacks on the shared user/kernel address space such "
"as the \"Meltdown\" approach [2]_."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:14
msgid ""
"To mitigate this class of attacks, we create an independent set of page "
"tables for use only when running userspace applications.  When the kernel is "
"entered via syscalls, interrupts or exceptions, the page tables are switched "
"to the full \"kernel\" copy.  When the system switches back to user mode, "
"the user copy is used again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:20
msgid ""
"The userspace page tables contain only a minimal amount of kernel data: only "
"what is needed to enter/exit the kernel such as the entry/exit functions "
"themselves and the interrupt descriptor table (IDT).  There are a few "
"strictly unnecessary things that get mapped such as the first C function "
"when entering an interrupt (see comments in pti.c)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:27
msgid ""
"This approach helps to ensure that side-channel attacks leveraging the "
"paging structures do not function when PTI is enabled.  It can be enabled by "
"setting CONFIG_MITIGATION_PAGE_TABLE_ISOLATION=y at compile time.  Once "
"enabled at compile-time, it can be disabled at boot with the 'nopti' or "
"'pti=' kernel parameters (see kernel-parameters.txt)."

msgid "Page Table Management"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:36
msgid ""
"When PTI is enabled, the kernel manages two sets of page tables. The first "
"set is very similar to the single set which is present in kernels without "
"PTI.  This includes a complete mapping of userspace that the kernel can use "
"for things like copy_to_user()."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:41
msgid ""
"Although _complete_, the user portion of the kernel page tables is crippled "
"by setting the NX bit in the top level.  This ensures that any missed kernel-"
">user CR3 switch will immediately crash userspace upon executing its first "
"instruction."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:46
msgid ""
"The userspace page tables map only the kernel data needed to enter and exit "
"the kernel.  This data is entirely contained in the 'struct cpu_entry_area' "
"structure which is placed in the fixmap which gives each CPU's copy of the "
"area a compile-time-fixed virtual address."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:51
msgid ""
"For new userspace mappings, the kernel makes the entries in its page tables "
"like normal.  The only difference is when the kernel makes entries in the "
"top (PGD) level.  In addition to setting the entry in the main kernel PGD, a "
"copy of the entry is made in the userspace page tables' PGD."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:57
msgid ""
"This sharing at the PGD level also inherently shares all the lower layers of "
"the page tables.  This leaves a single, shared set of userspace page tables "
"to manage.  One PTE to lock, one set of accessed bits, dirty bits, etc..."

"The 'cpu_entry_area' structure must be 2MB in size and 2MB aligned so that "

"CR3 manipulation to switch between the page table copies must be done at "

"Percpu TSS is mapped into the user page tables to allow SYSCALL64 path to "

msgid ""
"Global pages are disabled for all kernel structures not mapped into both "
"kernel and userspace page tables.  This feature of the MMU allows different "
"processes to share TLB entries mapping the kernel.  Losing the feature means "
"more TLB misses after a context switch.  The actual loss of performance is "
"very small, however, never exceeding 1%."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:93
msgid ""
"Process Context IDentifiers (PCID) is a CPU feature that allows us to skip "
"flushing the entire TLB when switching page tables by setting a special bit "
"in CR3 when the page tables are changed.  This makes switching the page "
"tables (at context switch, or kernel entry/exit) cheaper.  But, on systems "
"with PCID support, the context switch code must flush both the user and "
"kernel entries out of the TLB.  The user PCID TLB flush is deferred until "
"the exit to userspace, minimizing the cost. See intel.com/sdm for the gory "
"PCID/INVPCID details."

"The userspace page tables must be populated for each new process.  Even "
"without PTI, the shared kernel mappings are created by copying top-level "
"(PGD) entries into each new process.  But, with PTI, there are now *two* "
"kernel mappings: one in the kernel page tables that maps everything and one "
"for the entry/exit structures.  At fork(), we need to copy both."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../arch/x86/pti.rst:109
msgid ""
"In addition to the fork()-time copying, there must also be an update to the "
"userspace PGD any time a set_pgd() is done on a PGD used to map userspace.  "
"This ensures that the kernel and userspace copies always map the same "
"userspace memory."
msgstr ""

"On systems without PCID support, each CR3 write flushes the entire TLB.  "

msgid ""
"INVPCID is a TLB-flushing instruction which allows flushing of TLB entries "
"for non-current PCIDs.  Some systems support PCIDs, but do not support "
"INVPCID.  On these systems, addresses can only be flushed from the TLB for "
"the current PCID.  When flushing a kernel address, we need to flush all "
"PCIDs, so a single kernel address flush will require a TLB-flushing CR3 "
"write upon the next use of every PCID."
