"Linux/x86-64 supports CPU hotplug now. For various reasons Linux wants to "
"know in advance of boot time the maximum number of CPUs that could be "
"plugged into the system. ACPI 3.0 currently has no official way to supply "
"this information from the firmware to the operating system."

"In ACPI each CPU needs an LAPIC object in the MADT table (5.2.11.5 in the "
"ACPI 3.0 specification).  ACPI already has the concept of disabled LAPIC "
"objects by setting the Enabled bit in the LAPIC object to zero."

"For CPU hotplug Linux/x86-64 expects now that any possible future "
"hotpluggable CPU is already available in the MADT. If the CPU is not "
"available yet it should have its LAPIC Enabled bit set to 0. Linux will use "
"the number of disabled LAPICs to compute the maximum number of future CPUs."

"In the worst case the user can overwrite this choice using a command line "
"option (additional_cpus=...), but it is recommended to supply the correct "
"number (or a reasonable approximation of it, with erring towards more not "
"less) in the MADT to avoid manual configuration."
