"ARC processors are highly configurable and several configurable options are "
"supported in Linux. Some options are transparent to software (i.e cache "
"geometries, some can be detected at runtime and configured and used "
"accordingly, while some need to be explicitly selected or configured in the "

"However not all configurable options are supported when an ARC processor is "
