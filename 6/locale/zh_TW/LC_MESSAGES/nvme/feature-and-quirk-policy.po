"NVMe is a large suite of specifications, and contains features that are only "
"useful or suitable for specific use-cases. It is important to note that "
"Linux does not aim to implement every feature in the specification.  Every "
"additional feature implemented introduces more code, more maintenance and "
"potentially more bugs.  Hence there is an inherent tradeoff between "
"functionality and maintainability of the NVMe host driver."

"Sometimes implementations of open standards fail to correctly implement "

"The Linux NVMe maintainers decide ad hoc whether to quirk implementations "

"Quirks will not be added to the Linux kernel for hardware that isn't "

"enterprise Linux distributions, ChromeOS, Android or other consumers of the "
"Linux kernel should be fixed before it is shipped instead of relying on "
"Linux quirks."
