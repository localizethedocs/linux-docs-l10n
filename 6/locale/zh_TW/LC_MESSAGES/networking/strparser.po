"The stream parser (strparser) is a utility that parses messages of an "
"application layer protocol running over a data stream. The stream parser "
"works in conjunction with an upper layer in the kernel to provide kernel "
"support for application layer messages. For instance, Kernel Connection "
"Multiplexor (KCM) uses the Stream Parser to parse messages using a BPF "
"program."

"The strparser works in one of two modes: receive callback or general mode."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/strparser.rst:20
msgid ""
"In receive callback mode, the strparser is called from the data_ready "
"callback of a TCP socket. Messages are parsed and delivered as they are "
"received on the socket."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/strparser.rst:24
msgid ""
"In general mode, a sequence of skbs are fed to strparser from an outside "
"source. Message are parsed and delivered as the sequence is processed. This "
"modes allows strparser to be applied to arbitrary streams of data."

"The API includes a context structure, a set of callbacks, utility functions, "
"and a data_ready function for receive callback mode. The callbacks include a "
"parse_msg function that is called to perform parsing (e.g.  BPF parsing in "
"case of KCM), and a rcv_msg function that is called when a full message has "
"been completed."

"Called to initialize a stream parser. strp is a struct of type strparser "
"that is allocated by the upper layer. sk is the TCP socket associated with "
"the stream parser for use with receive callback mode; in general mode this "
"is set to NULL. Callbacks are called by the stream parser (the callbacks are "
"listed below)."

"strp_stop is called to completely stop stream parser operations. This is "

"strp_done is called to release any resources held by the stream parser "

"strp_process is called in general mode for a stream parser to parse an "
"sk_buff. The number of bytes processed or a negative error number is "

"The upper layer calls strp_tcp_data_ready when data is ready on the lower "

"timeout for the socket."
