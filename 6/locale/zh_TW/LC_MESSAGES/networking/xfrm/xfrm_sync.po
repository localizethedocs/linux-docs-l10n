"The end goal for syncing is to be able to insert attributes + generate "
"events so that the SA can be safely moved from one machine to another for HA "
"purposes. The idea is to synchronize the SA so that the takeover machine can "
"do the processing of the SA as accurate as possible if it has access to it."

"We already have the ability to generate SA add/del/upd events. These patches "
"add ability to sync and have accurate lifetime byte (to ensure proper decay "
"of SAs) and replay counters to avoid replay attacks with as minimal loss at "
"failover time. This way a backup stays as closely up-to-date as an active "
"member."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/xfrm/xfrm_sync.rst:23
msgid ""
"Because the above items change for every packet the SA receives, it is "
"possible for a lot of the events to be generated. For this reason, we also "
"add a nagle-like algorithm to restrict the events. i.e we are going to set "
"thresholds to say \"let me know if the replay sequence threshold is reached "
"or 10 secs have passed\" These thresholds are set system-wide via sysctls or "
"can be updated per SA."

"The identified items that need to be synchronized are: - the lifetime byte "
"counter note that: lifetime time limit is not important if you assume the "
"failover machine is known ahead of time since the decay of the time "
"countdown is not driven by packet arrival. - the replay sequence for both "
"inbound and outbound"
