"The ``devlink-flash`` API allows updating device firmware. It replaces the "
"older ``ethtool-flash`` mechanism, and doesn't require taking any networking "
"locks in the kernel to perform the flash update. Example use::"

"Multiple overwrite bits may be combined and requested together. If no bits "

msgid ""
"Devices which require firmware to operate usually store it in non-volatile "
"memory on the board, e.g. flash. Some devices store only basic firmware on "
"the board, and the driver loads the rest from disk during probing. ``devlink-"
"info`` allows users to query firmware information (loaded components and "
"versions)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/devlink/devlink-flash.rst:56

"In other cases the device can both store the image on the board, load from "

msgid ""
"The ``driver`` attribute and ``fixed`` group identify the specific device "
"design, e.g. for looking up applicable firmware updates. This is why "
"``serial_number`` is not part of the ``fixed`` versions (even though it is "

"For the convenience of identifying firmware files some vendors add "
"``bundle_id`` information to the firmware versions. This meta-version covers "
"multiple per-component versions and can be used e.g. in firmware file names "
"(all component versions could get rather long.)"
