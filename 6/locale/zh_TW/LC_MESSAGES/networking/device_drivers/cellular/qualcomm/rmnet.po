"rmnet driver is used for supporting the Multiplexing and aggregation "
"Protocol (MAP). This protocol is used by all recent chipsets using Qualcomm "
"Technologies, Inc. modems."

"Multiplexing allows for creation of logical netdevices (rmnet devices) to "
"handle multiple private data networks (PDN) like a default internet, "
"tethering, multimedia messaging service (MMS) or IP media subsystem (IMS). "
"Hardware sends packets with MAP headers to rmnet. Based on the multiplexer "
"id, rmnet routes to the appropriate PDN after removing the MAP header."

"Aggregation is required to achieve high data rates. This involves hardware "
