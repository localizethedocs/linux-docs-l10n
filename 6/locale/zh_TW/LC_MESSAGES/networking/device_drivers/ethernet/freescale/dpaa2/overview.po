"DPAA2 is a hardware architecture designed for high-speeed network packet "

"Ethernet packets, queue management, buffer management, autonomous L2 "

"A DPAA2 hardware component called the Management Complex (or MC) manages the "
"DPAA2 hardware resources.  The MC provides an object-based abstraction for "
"software drivers to use the DPAA2 hardware. The MC uses DPAA2 hardware "
"resources such as queues, buffer pools, and network ports to create "
"functional objects/devices such as network interfaces, an L2 switch, or "
"accelerator instances. The MC provides memory-mapped I/O command interfaces "
