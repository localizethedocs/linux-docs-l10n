"Identifier-locator addressing (ILA) is a technique used with IPv6 that "
"differentiates between location and identity of a network node. Part of an "
"address expresses the immutable identity of the node, and another part "
"indicates the location of the node which can be dynamic. Identifier-locator "
"addressing can be used to efficiently implement overlay networks for network "
"virtualization as well as solutions for use cases in mobility."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../networking/ila.rst:18
msgid ""
"ILA can be thought of as means to implement an overlay network without "
"encapsulation. This is accomplished by performing network address "
"translation on destination addresses as a packet traverses a network. To the "
"network, an ILA translated packet appears to be no different than any other "
"IPv6 packet. For instance, if the transport protocol is TCP then an ILA "
"translated packet looks like just another TCP/IPv6 packet. The advantage of "
"this is that ILA is transparent to the network so that optimizations in the "
"network, such as ECMP, RSS, GRO, GSO, etc., just work."
