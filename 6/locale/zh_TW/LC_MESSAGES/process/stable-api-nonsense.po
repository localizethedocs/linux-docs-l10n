"You think you want a stable kernel interface, but you really do not, and you "
"don't even know it.  What you want is a stable running driver, and you get "
"that only if your driver is in the main kernel tree.  You also get lots of "
"other good benefits if your driver is in the main kernel tree, all of which "
"has made Linux into such a strong, stable, and mature operating system which "
"is the reason you are using it in the first place."

"Depending on the version of the C compiler you use, different kernel data "

"Now a number of these issues can be addressed by simply compiling your "
"module for the exact specific kernel configuration, using the same exact C "

"provide a module for a specific release version of a specific Linux "
"distribution.  But multiply that single build by the number of different "
"Linux distributions and the number of different supported releases of the "
"Linux distribution and you quickly have a nightmare of different build "
"options on different releases.  Also realize that each Linux distribution "
"release contains a number of different kernels, all tuned to different "
"hardware types (different processor types and different options), so for "
"even a single release you will need to create multiple versions of your "
"module."

"Linux kernel development is continuous and at a rapid pace, never stopping "
"to slow down.  As such, the kernel developers find bugs in current "
"interfaces, or figure out a better way to do things.  If they do that, they "
"then fix the current interfaces to work better.  When they do so, function "
"names may change, structures may grow or shrink, and function parameters may "
"be reworked.  If this happens, all of the instances of where this interface "
"is used within the kernel are fixed up at the same time, ensuring that "
"everything continues to work properly."

"As a specific examples of this, the in-kernel USB interfaces have undergone "

"A change from a synchronous model of data streams to an asynchronous one.  "
"This reduced the complexity of a number of drivers and increased the "

"devices at their maximum speed possible."
msgstr ""

"This is in stark contrast to a number of closed source operating systems "
"which have had to maintain their older USB interfaces over time.  This "

"interfaces and do things in improper ways, causing the stability of the "

"In both of these instances, all developers agreed that these were important "
"changes that needed to be made, and they were made, with relatively little "
"pain.  If Linux had to ensure that it will preserve a stable source "
"interface, a new interface would have been created, and the older, broken "
"one would have had to be maintained over time, leading to extra work for the "
"USB developers.  Since all Linux USB developers do their work on their own "
"time, asking programmers to do extra work for no gain, for free, is not a "
"possibility."

"Security issues are also very important for Linux.  When a security issue is "
"found, it is fixed in a very short amount of time.  A number of times this "
"has caused internal kernel interfaces to be reworked to prevent the security "
"problem from occurring.  When this happens, all drivers that use the "
"interfaces were also fixed at the same time, ensuring that the security "
"problem was fixed and could not come back at some future time accidentally.  "

"Kernel interfaces are cleaned up over time.  If there is no one using a "

"So, if you have a Linux kernel driver that is not in the main kernel tree, "

"Simple, get your kernel driver into the main kernel tree (remember we are "
"talking about drivers released under a GPL-compatible license here, if your "
"code doesn't fall under this category, good luck, you are on your own here, "
"you leech).  If your driver is in the tree, and a kernel interface changes, "
"it will be fixed up by the person who did the kernel change in the first "
