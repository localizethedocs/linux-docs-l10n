"The Linux kernel development project is widely distributed, with over 100 "
"maintainers each working to keep changes moving through their own "
"repositories. The final step, though, is a centralized one where changes are "
"pulled into the mainline repository. That is normally done by Linus Torvalds "
"but, as was demonstrated by the 4.19 release in 2018, there are others who "
"can do that work when the need arises."

"Should the maintainers of that repository become unwilling or unable to do "
"that work going forward (including facilitating a transition), the project "
"will need to find one or more replacements without delay. The process by "
"which that will be done is listed below. $ORGANIZER is the last Maintainer "
"Summit organizer or the current Linux Foundation (LF) Technical Advisory "
"Board (TAB) Chair as a backup."

"Within 72 hours, $ORGANIZER will open a discussion with the invitees of the "

"way that maximizes the number of people who can participate."
