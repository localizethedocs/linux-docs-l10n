"NetLabel is a mechanism which can be used by kernel security modules to "
"attach security attributes to outgoing network packets generated from user "
"space applications and read security attributes from incoming network "
"packets.  It is composed of three main components, the protocol engines, the "
"communication layer, and the kernel security module API."

#: ../../../netlabel/introduction.rst:21
msgid ""
"The protocol engines are responsible for both applying and retrieving the "
"network packet's security attributes.  If any translation between the "
"network security attributes and those on the host are required then the "
"protocol engine will handle those tasks as well.  Other kernel subsystems "
"should refrain from calling the protocol engines directly, instead they "
"should use the NetLabel kernel security module API described below."

"The communication layer exists to allow NetLabel configuration and "
"monitoring from user space.  The NetLabel communication layer uses a message "
"based protocol built on top of the Generic NETLINK transport mechanism.  The "
"exact formatting of these NetLabel messages as well as the Generic NETLINK "
"family names can be found in the 'net/netlabel/' directory as comments in "
"the header files as well as in 'include/net/netlabel.h'."

"The purpose of the NetLabel security module API is to provide a protocol "
"independent interface to the underlying NetLabel protocol engines.  In "
"addition to protocol independence, the security module API is designed to be "
"completely LSM independent which should allow multiple LSMs to leverage the "
"same code base."
