"I upgraded the kernel from 2.6.15 to 2.6.16. Both kernels were compiled with "
"the similar configuration files. Anyway I found that suspend to disk (and "
"resume) is much slower on 2.6.16 compared to 2.6.15. Any idea for why that "
"might happen or how can I speed it up?"

"There's the /sys/power/image_size knob that controls the size of the image.  "
"If you set it to 0 (eg. by echo 0 > /sys/power/image_size as root), the "
"2.6.15 behavior should be restored.  If it is still too slow, take a look at "
"suspend.sf.net -- userland suspend is faster and supports LZF compression to "
"speed it up further."
