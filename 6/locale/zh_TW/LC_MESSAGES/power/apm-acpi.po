"If you have a relatively recent x86 mobile, desktop, or server system, odds "
"are it supports either Advanced Power Management (APM) or Advanced "
"Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI).  ACPI is the newer of the two "
"technologies and puts power management in the hands of the operating system, "
"allowing for more intelligent power management than is possible with BIOS "
"controlled APM."

"The best way to determine which, if either, your system supports is to build "
"a kernel with both ACPI and APM enabled (as of 2.3.x ACPI is enabled by "
"default).  If a working ACPI implementation is found, the ACPI driver will "
"override and disable APM, otherwise the APM driver will be used."

"No, sorry, you cannot have both ACPI and APM enabled and running at once.  "
"Some people with broken ACPI or broken APM implementations would like to use "
"both to get a full set of working features, but you simply cannot mix and "
"match the two.  Only one power management interface can be in control of the "
"machine at once.  Think about it.."

"Both APM and ACPI rely on user-space daemons, apmd and acpid respectively, "
"to be completely functional.  Obtain both of these daemons from your Linux "
"distribution or from the Internet (see below) and be sure that they are "
"started sometime in the system boot process. Go ahead and start both.  If "
"ACPI or APM is not available on your system the associated daemon will exit "
"gracefully."
