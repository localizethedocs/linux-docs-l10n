"The Linux kernel handles swap files almost in the same way as it handles "
"swap partitions and there are only two differences between these two types "
"of swap areas: (1) swap files need not be contiguous, (2) the header of a "
"swap file is not in the first block of the partition that holds it.  From "
"the swsusp's point of view (1) is not a problem, because it is already taken "
"care of by the swap-handling code, but (2) has to be taken into "
"consideration."

"In principle the location of a swap file's header may be determined with the "
"help of appropriate filesystem driver.  Unfortunately, however, it requires "
"the filesystem holding the swap file to be mounted, and if this filesystem "
"is journaled, it cannot be mounted during resume from disk.  For this reason "
"to identify a swap file swsusp uses the name of the partition that holds the "
"file and the offset from the beginning of the partition at which the swap "
"file's header is located.  For convenience, this offset is expressed in "
"<PAGE_SIZE> units."
