"The Maintainer Entry Profile supplements the top-level process documents "
"(submitting-patches, submitting drivers...) with subsystem/device-driver-"
"local customs as well as details about the patch submission life-cycle. A "
"contributor uses this document to level set their expectations and avoid "
"common mistakes; maintainers may use these profiles to look across "
"subsystems for opportunities to converge on common practices."

"One of the common misunderstandings of submitters is that patches can be "
"sent at any time before the merge window closes and can still be considered "
"for the next -rc1. The reality is that most patches need to be settled in "
"soaking in linux-next in advance of the merge window opening. Clarify for "
