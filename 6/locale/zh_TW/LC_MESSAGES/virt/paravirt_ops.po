"Linux provides support for different hypervisor virtualization technologies. "
"Historically, different binary kernels would be required in order to support "
"different hypervisors; this restriction was removed with pv_ops. Linux "
"pv_ops is a virtualization API which enables support for different "
"hypervisors. It allows each hypervisor to override critical operations and "
"allows a single kernel binary to run on all supported execution environments "
"including native machine -- without any hypervisors."

"pv_ops provides a set of function pointers which represent operations "
"corresponding to low-level critical instructions and high-level "
"functionalities in various areas. pv_ops allows for optimizations at run "
"time by enabling binary patching of the low-level critical operations at "
"boot time."
