msgid ""
"On modern systems the platform performance, temperature, fan and other "
"hardware related characteristics are often dynamically configurable. The "
"platform configuration is often automatically adjusted to the current "
"conditions by some automatic mechanism (which may very well live outside the "
"kernel)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/sysfs-platform_profile.rst:11
msgid ""
"These auto platform adjustment mechanisms often can be configured with one "
"of several platform profiles, with either a bias towards low power operation "
"or towards performance."

"The purpose of the platform_profile attribute is to offer a generic sysfs "
"API for selecting the platform profile of these automatic mechanisms."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/sysfs-platform_profile.rst:18
msgid ""
"Note that this API is only for selecting the platform profile, it is NOT a "
"goal of this API to allow monitoring the resulting performance "
"characteristics. Monitoring performance is best done with device/vendor "
"specific tools, e.g. turbostat."

#: ../../../userspace-api/sysfs-platform_profile.rst:23
msgid ""
"Specifically, when selecting a high performance profile the actual achieved "
"performance may be limited by various factors such as: the heat generated by "
"other components, room temperature, free air flow at the bottom of a laptop, "
"etc. It is explicitly NOT a goal of this API to let userspace know about any "
"sub-optimal conditions which are impeding reaching the requested performance "
"level."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/sysfs-platform_profile.rst:30
msgid ""
"Since numbers on their own cannot represent the multiple variables that a "
"profile will adjust (power consumption, heat generation, etc) this API uses "
"strings to describe the various profiles. To make sure that userspace gets a "
"consistent experience the sysfs-platform_profile ABI document defines a "
"fixed set of profile names. Drivers *must* map their internal profile "
"representation onto this fixed set."

"The platform_profile class also supports profiles advertising a \"custom\" "
"profile. This is intended to be set by drivers when the settings in the "

msgid ""
"When multiple drivers on a system advertise a platform profile handler, the "
"platform profile handler core will only advertise the profiles that are "
"common between all drivers to the ``/sys/firmware/acpi`` interfaces."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../userspace-api/sysfs-platform_profile.rst:57
msgid ""
"This is to ensure there is no ambiguity on what the profile names mean when "

"Individual drivers will register a 'platform_profile' class device that has "

msgid ""
"This will allow users to set different profiles for different drivers on the "

"While the ``platform_profile`` attribute has the value ``custom``, writing a "
"common profile from ``platform_profile_choices`` to the platform_profile "
