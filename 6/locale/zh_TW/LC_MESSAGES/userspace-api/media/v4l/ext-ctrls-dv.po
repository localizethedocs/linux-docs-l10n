"HDMI (:ref:`hdmi`) and DisplayPort (:ref:`dp`). These controls are generally "

"Note that these devices can have multiple input or output pads which are "
"hooked up to e.g. HDMI connectors. Even though the subdevice will receive or "
"transmit video from/to only one of those pads, the other pads can still be "
"active when it comes to EDID (Extended Display Identification Data, :ref:"
"`vesaedid`) and HDCP (High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection System, :ref:"
"`hdcp`) processing, allowing the device to do the fairly slow EDID/HDCP "
"handling in advance. This allows for quick switching between connectors."
