"Input and output devices support the :c:func:`read()` and :c:func:`write()` "
"function, respectively, when the ``V4L2_CAP_READWRITE`` flag in the "
"``capabilities`` field of struct :c:type:`v4l2_capability` returned by the :"
"ref:`VIDIOC_QUERYCAP` ioctl is set."

"Drivers may need the CPU to copy the data, but they may also support DMA to "
"or from user memory, so this I/O method is not necessarily less efficient "
"than other methods merely exchanging buffer pointers. It is considered "
"inferior though because no meta-information like frame counters or "
"timestamps are passed. This information is necessary to recognize frame "
"dropping and to synchronize with other data streams. However this is also "
"the simplest I/O method, requiring little or no setup to exchange data. It "
"permits command line stunts like this (the vidctrl tool is fictitious):"

"To read from the device applications use the :c:func:`read()` function, to "
"write the :c:func:`write()` function. Drivers must implement one I/O method "
"if they exchange data with applications, but it need not be this. [#f1]_ "
"When reading or writing is supported, the driver must also support the :c:"
"func:`select()` and :c:func:`poll()` function. [#f2]_"

"It would be desirable if applications could depend on drivers supporting all "
"I/O interfaces, but as much as the complex memory mapping I/O can be "
"inadequate for some devices we have no reason to require this interface, "
"which is most useful for simple applications capturing still images."

"At the driver level :c:func:`select()` and :c:func:`poll()` are the same, "
