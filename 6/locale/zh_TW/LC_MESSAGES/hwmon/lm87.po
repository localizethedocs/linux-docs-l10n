"This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor LM87 and the "
"Analog Devices ADM1024."

#: ../../../hwmon/lm87.rst:38
msgid ""
"The LM87 implements up to three temperature sensors, up to two fan rotation "
"speed sensors, up to seven voltage sensors, alarms, and some miscellaneous "
"stuff. The ADM1024 is fully compatible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm87.rst:42
msgid ""
"Temperatures are measured in degrees Celsius. Each input has a high and low "
"alarm settings. A high limit produces an alarm when the value goes above it, "
"and an alarm is also produced when the value goes below the low limit."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm87.rst:47
msgid ""
"Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM (rotations per minute). An alarm is "
"triggered if the rotation speed has dropped below a programmable limit. Fan "
"readings can be divided by a programmable divider (1, 2, 4 or 8) to give the "
"readings more range or accuracy. Not all RPM values can accurately be "
"represented, so some rounding is done. With a divider of 2, the lowest "
"representable value is around 2600 RPM."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm87.rst:54
msgid ""
"Voltage sensors (also known as IN sensors) report their values in volts. An "
"alarm is triggered if the voltage has crossed a programmable minimum or "
"maximum limit. Note that minimum in this case always means 'closest to "
"zero'; this is important for negative voltage measurements."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm87.rst:59
msgid ""
"If an alarm triggers, it will remain triggered until the hardware register "
"is read at least once. This means that the cause for the alarm may already "
"have disappeared! Note that in the current implementation, all hardware "
"registers are read whenever any data is read (unless it is less than 1.0 "
"seconds since the last update). This means that you can easily miss once-"
"only alarms."

"The lm87 driver only updates its values each 1.0 seconds; reading it more "
"often will do no harm, but will return 'old' values."

"depending on the hardware configuration."

#: ../../../hwmon/lm87.rst:76
msgid ""
"Some functions share pins, so not all functions are available at the same "
"time. Which are depends on the hardware setup. This driver normally assumes "
"that firmware configured the chip correctly. Where this is not the case, "
"platform code must set the I2C client's platform_data to point to a u8 value "
"to be written to the channel register."
