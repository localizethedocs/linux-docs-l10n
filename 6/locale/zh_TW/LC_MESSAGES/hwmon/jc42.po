"This driver implements support for JEDEC JC 42.4 compliant temperature "

"There is also an hysteresis to control the thresholds for resetting alarms. "
"Per JC 42.4 specification, the hysteresis threshold can be configured to 0, "
"1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 degrees C. Configured hysteresis values will be rounded to "
"those limits. The chip supports only a single register to configure the "
"hysteresis, which applies to all limits. This register can be written by "
