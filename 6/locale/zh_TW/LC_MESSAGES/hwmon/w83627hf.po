"This driver supports ISA accesses, which should be more reliable than i2c "
"accesses. Also, for Tyan boards which contain both a Super I/O chip and a "
"second i2c-only Winbond chip (often a W83782D), using this driver will avoid "
"i2c address conflicts and complex initialization that were required in the "

"The `w83627_HF_` uses pins 110-106 as VID0-VID4. The `w83627_THF_` uses the "
"same pins as GPIO[0:4]. Technically, the `w83627_THF_` does not support a "
"VID reading. However the two chips have the identical 128 pin package. So, "
"it is possible or even likely for a w83627thf to have the VID signals routed "
"to these pins despite their not being labeled for that purpose. Therefore, "
"the w83627thf driver interprets these as VID. If the VID on your board "
"doesn't work, first see doc/vid in the lm_sensors package[1]. If that still "
"doesn't help, you may just ignore the bogus VID reading with no harm done."
