"Andigilog has both the PECI and pre-PECI versions of the Heceta-6, as Intel "
"calls them. Heceta-6e has high frequency PWM and Heceta-6p has added PECI "
"and a 4th thermal zone. The Andigilog aSC7611 is the Heceta-6e part and "
"aSC7621 is the Heceta-6p part. They are both in volume production, shipping "
"to Intel and their subs."

"We have enhanced both parts relative to the governing Intel specification. "
"First enhancement is temperature reading resolution. We have used registers "
"below 20h for vendor-specific functions in addition to those in the Intel-"
"specified vendor range."

"Our conversion process produces a result that is reported as two bytes. The "
"fan speed control uses this finer value to produce a \"step-less\" fan PWM "
"output. These two bytes are \"read-locked\" to guarantee that once a high or "
"low byte is read, the other byte is locked-in until after the next read of "
"any register. So to get an atomic reading, read high or low byte, then the "
"very next read should be the opposite byte. Our data sheet says 10-bits of "
"resolution, although you may find the lower bits are active, they are not "
"necessarily reliable or useful externally. We chose not to mask them."

"PECI Extended configuration allows for having more than two domains per PECI "
