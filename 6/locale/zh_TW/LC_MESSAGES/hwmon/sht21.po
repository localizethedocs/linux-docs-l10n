"The SHT21 and SHT25 are humidity and temperature sensors in a DFN package of "
"only 3 x 3 mm footprint and 1.1 mm height. The difference between the two "
"devices is the higher level of precision of the SHT25 (1.8% relative "
"humidity, 0.2 degree Celsius) compared with the SHT21 (2.0% relative "
"humidity, 0.3 degree Celsius)."

"The driver uses the default resolution settings of 12 bit for humidity and "
"14 bit for temperature, which results in typical measurement times of 22 ms "
"for humidity and 66 ms for temperature. To keep self heating below 0.1 "
"degree Celsius, the device should not be active for more than 10% of the "
"time, e.g. maximum two measurements per second at the given resolution."
