"The fan speed is measured using a tachometer. Contrary to most chips which "
"store the value in an 8-bit register and have a selectable clock divider to "
"make sure that the result will fit in the register, the LM63 uses 16-bit "
"value for measuring the speed of the fan. It can measure fan speeds down to "
"83 RPM, at least in theory."

"Note that the pin used for fan monitoring is shared with an alert out "
"function. Depending on how the board designer wanted to use the chip, fan "
"speed monitoring will or will not be possible. The proper chip configuration "
"is left to the BIOS, and the driver will blindly trust it. Only the original "
"LM63 suffers from this limitation, the LM64 and LM96163 have separate pins "
"for fan monitoring and alert out. On the LM64, monitoring is always enabled; "
"on the LM96163 it can be disabled."

"A PWM output can be used to control the speed of the fan. The LM63 has two "
"PWM modes: manual and automatic. Automatic mode is not fully implemented yet "
"(you cannot define your custom PWM/temperature curve), and mode change isn't "
"supported either."

"The lm63 driver will not update its values more frequently than configured "
"with the update_interval sysfs attribute; reading them more often will do no "
"harm, but will return 'old' values. Values in the automatic fan control "
"lookup table (attributes pwm1_auto_*) have their own independent lifetime of "
"5 seconds."
