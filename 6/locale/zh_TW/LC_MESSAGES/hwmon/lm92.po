"This driver implements support for the National Semiconductor / Texas "
"Instruments LM92 temperature sensor."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/lm92.rst:42
msgid ""
"Each LM92 temperature sensor supports a single temperature sensor. There are "
"alarms for high, low, and critical thresholds. There's also an hysteresis to "
"control the thresholds for resetting alarms."

msgid ""
"The driver also supports LM76 and Maxim MAX6633/MAX6634/MAX6635, which are "
"mostly compatible but do not have a vendor ID register and therefore must be "
"instantiated explicitly."
