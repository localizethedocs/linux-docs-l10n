"The National Semiconductor Super I/O chip includes complete hardware "
"monitoring capabilities. It can monitor up to 18 voltages, 8 fans and 6 "
"temperature sensors. Only the fans and temperatures are supported at the "
"moment, voltages aren't."

"This chip also has fan controlling features (up to 4 PWM outputs), which are "
"partly supported by this driver."

"The driver assumes that no more than one chip is present, which seems "

"Fan speed can be controlled by PWM outputs. There are 4 possible modes: "
"always off, always on, manual and automatic. The latter isn't supported by "
"the driver: you can only return to that mode if it was the original setting, "
"and the configuration interface is missing."

"The PC87427 relies on external sensors (following the SensorPath standard), "
"so the resolution and range depend on the type of sensor connected. The "
"integer part can be 8-bit or 9-bit, and can be signed or not. I couldn't "
"find a way to figure out the external sensor data temperature format, so "
"user-space adjustment (typically by a factor 2) may be required."
