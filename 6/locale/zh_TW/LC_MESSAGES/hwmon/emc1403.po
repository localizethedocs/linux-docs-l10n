"The Standard Microsystems Corporation (SMSC) / Microchip EMC14xx chips "
"contain up to eight temperature sensors. EMC14x2 support two sensors (one "
"internal, one external). EMC14x3 support three sensors (one internal, two "
"external), EMC14x4 support four sensors (one internal, three external), and "
"EMC14x8 support eight sensors (one internal, seven external)."

"The chips implement three limits for each sensor: low (tempX_min), high "
"(tempX_max) and critical (tempX_crit.) The chips also implement an "
"hysteresis mechanism which applies to all limits. The relative difference is "
"stored in a single register on the chip, which means that the relative "
"difference between the limit and its hysteresis is always the same for all "
"three limits."

#: ../../../hwmon/emc1403.rst:81
msgid ""
"When setting a limit, its hysteresis will automatically follow, the "
"difference staying unchanged. For example, if the old critical limit was 80 "
"degrees C, and the hysteresis was 75 degrees C, and you change the critical "
"limit to 90 degrees C, then the hysteresis will automatically change to 85 "
"degrees C."

msgid ""
"The hysteresis values can't be set independently. We decided to make only "
"temp1_crit_hyst writable, while all other hysteresis attributes are read-"
"only. Setting temp1_crit_hyst writes the difference between temp1_crit_hyst "
"and temp1_crit into the chip, and the same relative hysteresis applies "
"automatically to all other limits."
