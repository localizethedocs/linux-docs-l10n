"This driver implements support for Microchip EMC2301/2/3/5 RPM-based PWM Fan "
"Controller. The EMC2305 Fan Controller supports up to 5 independently "
"controlled PWM fan drives. Fan rotation speeds are reported in RPM. The "
"driver supports the RPM-based PWM control to keep a fan at the desired "
"speed. The driver provides the possibility to have one common PWM interface "
"for all FANs or up to the maximum available or configured independent PWMs."
