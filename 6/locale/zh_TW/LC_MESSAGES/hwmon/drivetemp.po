"If supported, it uses the ATA SCT Command Transport feature to read the "
"current drive temperature and, if available, temperature limits as well as "
"historic minimum and maximum temperatures. If SCT Command Transport is not "
"supported, the driver uses SMART attributes to read the drive temperature."

"Reading the drive temperature may reset the spin down timer on some drives. "
"This has been observed with WD120EFAX drives, but may be seen with other "
"drives as well. The same behavior is observed if the 'hdtemp' or 'smartd' "
"tools are used to access the drive. With the WD120EFAX drive, reading the "
"drive temperature using the drivetemp driver is still possible _after_ it "
"transitioned to standby mode, and reading the drive temperature in this mode "
"will not cause the drive to change its mode (meaning the drive will not spin "
"up). It is unknown if other drives experience similar behavior."

"A known workaround for WD120EFAX drives is to read the drive temperature at "
"intervals larger than twice the spin-down time. Otherwise affected drives "
"will never spin down."
