"The GMT G760A Fan Speed PWM Controller is connected directly to a fan and "
"performs closed-loop control of the fan speed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/g760a.rst:22
msgid ""
"The fan speed is programmed by setting the period via 'pwm1' of two "
"consecutive speed pulses. The period is defined in terms of clock cycle "
"counts of an assumed 32kHz clock source."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/g760a.rst:26
msgid ""
"Setting a period of 0 stops the fan; setting the period to 255 sets fan to "
"maximum speed."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/g760a.rst:29
msgid ""
"The measured fan rotation speed returned via 'fan1_input' is derived from "
"the measured speed pulse period by assuming again a 32kHz clock source and a "
"2 pulse-per-revolution fan."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../hwmon/g760a.rst:33
msgid ""
"The 'alarms' file provides access to the two alarm bits provided by the "
"G760A chip's status register: Bit 0 is set when the actual fan speed differs "
"more than 20% with respect to the programmed fan speed; bit 1 is set when "
"fan speed is below 1920 RPM."

msgid ""
"The g760a driver will not update its values more frequently than every other "
"second; reading them more often will do no harm, but will return 'old' "
"values."
