"LTC2990 is a Quad I2C Voltage, Current and Temperature Monitor. The chip's "
"inputs can measure 4 voltages, or two inputs together (1+2 and 3+4) can be "
"combined to measure a differential voltage, which is typically used to "
"measure current through a series resistor, or a temperature with an external "
"diode."
