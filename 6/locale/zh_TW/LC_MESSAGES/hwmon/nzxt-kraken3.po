"This driver enables hardware monitoring support for NZXT Kraken X53/X63/X73, "
"Z53/Z63/Z73 and Kraken 2023 (standard and Elite) all-in-one CPU liquid "
"coolers. All models expose liquid temperature and pump speed (in RPM), as "
"well as PWM control (either as a fixed value or through a temp-PWM curve). "
"The Z-series and Kraken 2023 models additionally expose the speed and duty "
"of an optionally connected fan, with the same PWM control capabilities."

"Pump and fan duty control mode can be set through pwm[1-2]_enable, where 1 "
"is for the manual control mode and 2 is for the liquid temp to PWM curve "
"mode. Writing a 0 disables control of the channel through the driver after "
"setting its duty to 100%."

"The temperature of the curves relates to the fixed [20-59] range, "
"correlating to the detected liquid temperature. Only PWM values (ranging "
"from 0-255) can be set. If in curve mode, setting point values should be "
"done in moderation - the devices require complete curves to be sent for each "
"change; they can lock up or discard the changes if they are too numerous at "
"once. Suggestion is to set them while in an another mode, and then apply "
"them by switching to curve."
