"The ib_ipoib driver is an implementation of the IP over InfiniBand protocol "
"as specified by RFC 4391 and 4392, issued by the IETF ipoib working group.  "
"It is a \"native\" implementation in the sense of setting the interface type "
"to ARPHRD_INFINIBAND and the hardware address length to 20 (earlier "
"proprietary implementations masqueraded to the kernel as ethernet "
"interfaces)."

"When the IPoIB driver is loaded, it creates one interface for each port "

"write the desired P_Key into the main interface's /sys/class/net/<intf name>/"
"create_child file.  For example::"

msgid ""
"The IPoIB driver supports two modes of operation: datagram and connected.  "
"The mode is set and read through an interface's /sys/class/net/<intf name>/"
"mode file."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../infiniband/ipoib.rst:40
msgid ""
"In datagram mode, the IB UD (Unreliable Datagram) transport is used and so "
"the interface MTU has is equal to the IB L2 MTU minus the IPoIB "
"encapsulation header (4 bytes).  For example, in a typical IB fabric with a "
"2K MTU, the IPoIB MTU will be 2048 - 4 = 2044 bytes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../infiniband/ipoib.rst:45
msgid ""
"In connected mode, the IB RC (Reliable Connected) transport is used. "
"Connected mode takes advantage of the connected nature of the IB transport "
"and allows an MTU up to the maximal IP packet size of 64K, which reduces the "
"number of IP packets needed for handling large UDP datagrams, TCP segments, "
"etc and increases the performance for large messages."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../infiniband/ipoib.rst:52
msgid ""
"In connected mode, the interface's UD QP is still used for multicast and "
"communication with peers that don't support connected mode. In this case, RX "
"emulation of ICMP PMTU packets is used to cause the networking stack to use "
"the smaller UD MTU for these neighbours."

"Large Receive (LRO) offloading is also implemented and may be turned on/off "

msgid ""
"If the underlying IB device supports CQ event moderation, one can use "
"ethtool to set interrupt mitigation parameters and thus reduce the overhead "
"incurred by handling interrupts.  The main code path of IPoIB doesn't use "
"events for TX completion signaling so only RX moderation is supported."
