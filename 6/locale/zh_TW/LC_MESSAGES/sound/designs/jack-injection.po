"Here jack injection means users could inject plugin or plugout events to the "
"audio jacks through debugfs interface, it is helpful to validate ALSA "
"userspace changes. For example, we change the audio profile switching code "
"in the pulseaudio, and we want to verify if the change works as expected and "
"if the change introduce the regression, in this case, we could inject plugin "
"or plugout events to an audio jack or to some audio jacks, we don't need to "
"physically access the machine and plug/unplug physical devices to the audio "
"jack."

"In this design, an audio jack doesn't equal to a physical audio jack. "
"Sometimes a physical audio jack contains multi functions, and the ALSA "
"driver creates multi ``jack_kctl`` for a ``snd_jack``, here the ``snd_jack`` "
"represents a physical audio jack and the ``jack_kctl`` represents a "
"function, for example a physical jack has two functions: headphone and "
"mic_in, the ALSA ASoC driver will build 2 ``jack_kctl`` for this jack. The "
"jack injection is implemented based on the ``jack_kctl`` instead of "
"``snd_jack``."

"To inject events to audio jacks, we need to enable the jack injection via "
"``sw_inject_enable`` first, once it is enabled, this jack will not change "
"the state by hardware events anymore, we could inject plugin or plugout "
"events via ``jackin_inject`` and check the jack state via ``status``, after "
"we finish our test, we need to disable the jack injection via "
"``sw_inject_enable`` too, once it is disabled, the jack state will be "
"restored according to the last reported hardware events and will change by "
"future hardware events."
