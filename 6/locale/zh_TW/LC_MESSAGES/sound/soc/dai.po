"ASoC currently supports the three main Digital Audio Interfaces (DAI) found "
"on SoC controllers and portable audio CODECs today, namely AC97, I2S and PCM."

"AC97 is a five wire interface commonly found on many PC sound cards. It is "
"now also popular in many portable devices. This DAI has a RESET line and "
"time multiplexes its data on its SDATA_OUT (playback) and SDATA_IN (capture) "
"lines. The bit clock (BCLK) is always driven by the CODEC (usually "
"12.288MHz) and the frame (FRAME) (usually 48kHz) is always driven by the "
"controller. Each AC97 frame is 21uS long and is divided into 13 time slots."

msgid ""
"I2S is a common 4 wire DAI used in HiFi, STB and portable devices. The Tx "
"and Rx lines are used for audio transmission, while the bit clock (BCLK) and "
"left/right clock (LRC) synchronise the link. I2S is flexible in that either "
"the controller or CODEC can drive (master) the BCLK and LRC clock lines. Bit "
"clock usually varies depending on the sample rate and the master system "
"clock (SYSCLK). LRCLK is the same as the sample rate. A few devices support "
"separate ADC and DAC LRCLKs, this allows for simultaneous capture and "
"playback at different sample rates."

#: ../../../sound/soc/dai.rst:50
msgid ""
"PCM is another 4 wire interface, very similar to I2S, which can support a "
"more flexible protocol. It has bit clock (BCLK) and sync (SYNC) lines that "
"are used to synchronise the link while the Tx and Rx lines are used to "
"transmit and receive the audio data. Bit clock usually varies depending on "
"sample rate while sync runs at the sample rate. PCM also supports Time "
"Division Multiplexing (TDM) in that several devices can use the bus "
"simultaneously (this is sometimes referred to as network mode)."
