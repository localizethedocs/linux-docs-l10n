"Every audio subsystem is driven by a master clock (sometimes referred to as "
"MCLK or SYSCLK). This audio master clock can be derived from a number of "
"sources (e.g. crystal, PLL, CPU clock) and is responsible for producing the "
"correct audio playback and capture sample rates."

msgid ""
"Some master clocks (e.g. PLLs and CPU based clocks) are configurable in that "
"their speed can be altered by software (depending on the system use and to "
"save power). Other master clocks are fixed at a set frequency (i.e. "
"crystals)."

"The Digital Audio Interface is usually driven by a Bit Clock (often referred "
"to as BCLK). This clock is used to drive the digital audio data across the "
"link between the codec and CPU."

"The DAI also has a frame clock to signal the start of each audio frame. This "
"clock is sometimes referred to as LRC (left right clock) or FRAME. This "
"clock runs at exactly the sample rate (LRC = Rate)."

"This relationship depends on the codec or SoC CPU in particular. In general "

"It is also desirable to use the codec (if possible) to drive (or master) the "
