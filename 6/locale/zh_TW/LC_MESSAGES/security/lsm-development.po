"org, a new LSM is accepted into the kernel when its intent (a description of "
"what it tries to protect against and in what cases one would expect to use "
"it) has been appropriately documented in ``Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/``. "
"This allows an LSM's code to be easily compared to its goals, and so that "
"end users and distros can make a more informed decision about which LSMs "
"suit their requirements."

"Register a verified integrity measurement of a bdev with LSMs. LSMs should "
"free the previously saved data if **value** is NULL. Please note that the "
"new hook should be invoked every time the security information is updated to "
"keep these data current. For example, in dm-verity, if the mapping table is "
"reloaded and configured to use a different dm-verity target with a new "
"roothash and signing information, the previously stored data in the LSM blob "
"will become obsolete. It is crucial to re-invoke the hook to refresh these "
"data and ensure they are up to date. This necessity arises from the design "
"of device-mapper, where a device-mapper device is first created, and then "
"targets are subsequently loaded into it. These targets can be modified "
"multiple times during the device's lifetime. Therefore, while the LSM blob "
"is allocated during the creation of the block device, its actual contents "
"are not initialized at this stage and can change substantially over time. "
"This includes alterations from data that the LSMs 'trusts' to those they do "
"not, making it essential to handle these changes correctly. Failure to "
"address this dynamic aspect could potentially allow for bypassing LSM checks."
