"The goal of this work is to provide TPM functionality to each Linux "
"container. This allows programs to interact with a TPM in a container the "
"same way they interact with a TPM on the physical system. Each container "
"gets its own unique, emulated, software TPM."

"To make an emulated software TPM available to each container, the container "
"management stack needs to create a device pair consisting of a client TPM "
"character device ``/dev/tpmX`` (with X=0,1,2...) and a 'server side' file "
"descriptor. The former is moved into the container by creating a character "
"device with the appropriate major and minor numbers while the file "
"descriptor is passed to the TPM emulator. Software inside the container can "
"then send TPM commands using the character device and the emulator will "
"receive the commands via the file descriptor and use it for sending back "
"responses."

"To support this, the virtual TPM proxy driver provides a device ``/dev/"
"vtpmx`` that is used to create device pairs using an ioctl. The ioctl takes "
"as an input flags for configuring the device. The flags  for example "
"indicate whether TPM 1.2 or TPM 2 functionality is supported by the TPM "
"emulator. The result of the ioctl are the file descriptor for the 'server "
"side' as well as the major and minor numbers of the character device that "
"was created. Besides that the number of the TPM character device is "
"returned. If for example ``/dev/tpm10`` was created, the number "
"(``dev_num``) 10 is returned."

"Once the device has been created, the driver will immediately try to talk to "
"the TPM. All commands from the driver can be read from the file descriptor "
"returned by the ioctl. The commands should be responded to immediately."
