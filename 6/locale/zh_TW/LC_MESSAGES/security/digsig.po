"Digital signature verification is implemented using cut-down kernel port of "
"GnuPG multi-precision integers (MPI) library. The kernel port provides "
"memory allocation errors handling, has been refactored according to kernel "
"coding style, and checkpatch.pl reported errors and warnings have been fixed."

"keyid equals to SHA1[12-19] over the total key content. Signature header is "
"used as an input to generate a signature. Such approach insures that key or "
"signature header could not be changed. It protects timestamp from been "
"changed and can be used for rollback protection."

"The signing and key management utilities evm-utils provide functionality to "

"PEM or converted to the kernel format. When the key is added to the kernel "
